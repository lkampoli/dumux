  abstract = {Phenotypic mutants of Sporosarcina pasteurii (previously known as
	Bacillus pasteurii) (MTCC 1761) were developed by UV irradiation
	to test their ability to enhance urease activity and calcite production.
	Among the mutants, Bp M-3 was found to be more efficient compared
	to other mutants and wild-type strain. It produced the highest urease
	activity and calcite production compared to other isolates. The production
	of extracellular polymeric substances and biofilm was also higher
	in this mutant than other isolates. Microbial sand plugging results
	showed the highest calcite precipitation by Bp M-3 mutant. Scanning
	electron micrography, energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction
	analyses evidenced the direct involvement of bacteria in CaCO3 precipitation.
	This study suggests that calcite production by the mutant through
	biomineralization processes is highly effective and may provide a
	useful strategy as a sealing agent for filling the gaps or cracks
	and fissures in any construction structures.},

  abstract = {The subsurface biosphere on Earth appears to be far more expansive
	and physiologically and phylogenetically complex than previously
	thought. Here, several aspects of subsurface microbiology are discussed.
	Molecular and biogeochemical data, as well as characteristics from
	new isolates, suggest that ecosystems below deep-sea hydrothermal
	vents are inhabited primarily by thermophilic archaea and bacteria.
	The void spaces and conduits in basalt at mid-ocean ridges, and,
	even more so, at sediment-covered hydrothermal vent sites represent
	promising hunting grounds for novel chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria.
	As examples, we highlight the subsurface microbial communities within
	the basalt flanks of the Juan de Fuca Ridge off British Columbia,
	and the hydrothermal sediments at the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of
	California and at Middle Valley on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. In the
	deep continental subsurface, microbial studies have primarily targeted
	aquifers in basaltic and granitic rock, with an almost exclusive
	emphasis on H2-driven chemolithoautotrophy. For example, in the subsurface
	water from Lidy Hot Springs, Idaho (USA), H2-consuming methanogenic
	archaea represent the most populous organisms, comprising >95\% of
	all cells. Besides H 2, other potential sources of chemical energy
	(reducing power) are considered, including abiotically synthesized
	organic matter and reduced sulfur compounds. In addition, the well-established
	sequences of redox couples in microbial metabolism are investigated
	at elevated temperatures using a thermodynamic approach. Values of
	p$\epsilon$o for 11 common reduction half-reactions are tabulated
	at 25, 50, 100, and 150°C. Although many modes of metabolism may
	be employed by subsurface biota, sulfate reduction appears to be
	one of the more ubiquitous strategies. Recent studies of sulfate-reducing
	archaea and bacteria in marine and continental systems are reviewed.

  abstract = {Reactive transport modeling was used to evaluate the performance of
	two similar column experiments. The experiments were designed to
	simulate the treatment of acid mine drainage through microbially
	mediated sulfate reduction and subsequent sulfide mineral precipitation
	by means of an organic carbon permeable reactive barrier. Principal
	reactions considered in the simulations include microbially mediated
	reduction of sulfate by organic matter, mineral dissolution/precipitation
	reactions, and aqueous complexation/hydrolysis reactions. Simulations
	of column 1, which contained composted leaf mulch, wood chips, sawdust,
	and sewage sludge as an organic carbon source, accurately predicted
	sulfate concentrations in the column effluent throughout the duration
	of the experiment using a single fixed rate constant for sulfate
	reduction of 6.9 x 10(-9) mol L(-1) s(-1). Using the same reduction
	rate for column 2, which contained only composted leaf mulch and
	sawdust as an organic carbon source, sulfate concentrations at the
	column outlet were overpredicted at late times, suggesting that sulfate
	reduction rates increased over the duration of the column experiment
	and that microbial growth kinetics may have played an important role.
	These modeling results suggest that the reactivity of the organic
	carbon treatment material with respect to sulfate reduction does
	not significantly decrease over the duration of the 14-month experiments.
	The ability of the columns to remove ferrous iron appears to be strongly
	influenced by the precipitation of siderite, which is enhanced by
	the dissolution of calcite. The simulations indicate that while calcite
	was available in the column, up to 0.02 mol L(-1) of ferrous iron
	was removed from solution as siderite and mackinawite. Later in the
	experiments after approximately 300 d, when calcite was depleted
	from the columns, mackinawite became the predominant iron sink. The
	ability of the column to remove ferrous iron as mackinawite was estimated
	to be approximately 0.005 mol L(-1) for column 1. As the precipitation
	of mackinawite is sulfide limited at later times, the amount of iron
	removed will ultimately depend on the reactivity of the organic mixture
	and the amount of sulfate reduced.},

  abstract = {In many natural and contaminated aquifers, geochemical processes result
	in the production or consumption of dissolved gases. In cases where
	methanogenesis or denitrification occurs, the production of gases
	may result in the formation and growth of gas bubbles below the water
	table. Near the water table, entrapment of atmospheric gases during
	water table rise may provide a significant source of O2 to waters
	otherwise depleted in O2. Furthermore, the presence of bubbles will
	affect the hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer, resulting in changes
	to the groundwater flow regime. The interactions between physical
	transport, biogeochemical processes, and gas bubble formation, entrapment
	and release is complex and requires suitable analysis tools. The
	objective of the present work is the development of a numerical model
	capable of quantitatively assessing these processes. The multicomponent
	reactive transport code MIN3P has been enhanced to simulate bubble
	growth and contraction due to in-situ gas production or consumption,
	bubble entrapment due to water table rise and subsequent re-equilibration
	of the bubble with ambient groundwater, and permeability changes
	due to trapped gas phase saturation. The resulting formulation allows
	for the investigation of complex geochemical systems where microbially
	mediated redox reactions both produce and consume gases as well as
	affect solution chemistry, alkalinity, and pH. The enhanced model
	has been used to simulate processes in a petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated
	aquifer where methanogenesis is an important redox process. The simulations
	are constrained by data from a crude oil spill site near Bemidji,
	MN. Our results suggest that permeability reduction in the methanogenic
	zone due to in-situ formation of gas bubbles, and dissolution of
	entrapped atmospheric bubbles near the water table, both work to
	attenuate the dissolved gas plume emanating from the source zone.
	Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that under the given conditions
	more than 50\% of all produced CH4 partitions to the gas phase or
	is aerobically oxidised near the water table, suggesting that these
	processes should be accounted for when assessing the rate and extent
	of methanogenic degradation of hydrocarbons.},

	the Paris Basin (France) is under development. Before effective containment
	can be assured, investigations need to be carried out on reservoir
	behavior when subjected to physical, chemical and mechanical perturbations
	induced by CO2 injections. The aim of this study is to present the
	numerical results of two CO2 injection scenarios, firstly with CO2-saturated
	water and secondly with pure supercritical CO2. The simulation results
	confirm the high reactivity of CO2-saturated water, which can dramatically
	damage the reservoir structure. On the other hand, supercritical
	CO2 injection appears to be weakly reactive, with a limited modification
	of well injectivity. Supercritical CO2 reacts differently to CO2-saturated
	solution: firstly, it dissolves into aqueous solution and it increases
	both water acidity and mineral dissolution potential, favoring augmented
	porosity. Following this step, numerical simulations demonstrate
	that hydraulic processes induced by supercritical CO2 injection are
	accompanied by a desiccation phenomenon of the porous medium. Irreducible
	water, entrapped in pores, sustains the increase in CO2 pressure.
	When the pressure is sufficiently high and under a continuous dry
	(without water vapor) CO2 flux, an evaporation process starts leading
	to the precipitation of salts and possibly other secondary minerals.
	Although there has been little focus on this desiccation process
	in the literature until now, it nevertheless must constitute an important
	risk of both a modification in porosity and well injectivity. © 2007

	(5-100 microM) of nickel, the cofactor of urease, to the medium further
	enhanced calcite precipitation by E. coli (pBU11). Calcite precipitation
	induced by both B. pasteurii and E. coli (pBU11) was inhibited in
	the presence of a urease inhibitor, acetohydroxamic acid (AHA). These
	observations on the recombinant urease have confirmed that urease
	activity is essential for microbiologically-induced calcite precipitation.
	Partially purified B. pasteurii urease was immobilized in polyurethane
	(PU) foam to compare the efficacy of calcite precipitation between
	the free and immobilized enzymes. The immobilized urease showed higher
	K(m) and lower V(max) values, which were reflected by a slower overall
	calcite precipitation. However, scanning electron micrographs (SEM)
	identified that the calcite precipitation occurred throughout the
	matrices of polyurethane. Furthermore, PU-immobilized urease retained
	higher enzymatic activities at high temperatures and in the presence
	of a high concentration of pronase, indicating that immobilization
	protects the enzyme activity from environmental changes.},

Morphologically distinct colonies were purified, and their responses to 21 selected physiological tests were determined. These isolates were quite diverse; 626 physiologically distinct types (i.e., types with a unique pattern of responses to the 21 tests) were detected among the 1,112 isolates obtained. Physiologically distinct types were isolated on concentrated and dilute media (only 11{\%} overlap between the groups); isolates from surface soils and subsurface sediments were also quite different (only 3{\%} overlap). The surface soil isolates more readily utilized all but 1 of 12 carbon sources offered, and a significantly larger proportion of them hydrolyzed esculin and gelatin. Only 4{\%} of the subsurface isolates fermented glucose, even though 82{\%} of them could use it aerobically. l-Malate and d-gluconate were utilized by at least 75{\%} of the subsurface isolates, and seven other carbon sources were used by at least 40{\%} of them. Subsurface isolates from different geological formations (depths) and, to a lesser extent, from the same geological formation at different boreholes differed distinctly in their group responses to certain physiological tests. Moreover, sediments from different depths and boreholes contained physiologically distinct types of bacteria. Thus, considerable bacterial diversity was observed in coastal plain subsurface sediments, even within defined geological formations.},

The features of our proposed model are (1) the use of Nakamura equation of state to predict the vapor fugacity coefficients and UNIQUAC equation to describe the non-ideality of liquid phase, (2) the use of multi-stage well-mixed model for the liquid and vapor flows with non-ideal rate-based model for urea thermal hydrolyser, (3) the reactions are assumed to take place in the liquid phase. The model incorporates reaction rates of urea hydrolysis and takes into account the effects of solution non-ideality and back mixing on the urea thermal hydrolyser performance. The rates of reaction are written in terms of activity of reactants which are determined using a thermodynamic framework for system of NH3-CO2-H2O-urea mixture. The model provides temperature and concentrations distribution of different components in the liquid and vapor phases along the height of urea thermal hydrolyser. The predicted data of the model were consistent with the plant data indicating validity of the model. Also the effects of key parameters on the performance of urea thermal hydrolyser such as the temperature and flow rate of the steam and wastewater were examined. The results of this work show each parameter that causes an increase in temperature level along the urea thermal hydrolyser improves the urea removal efficiency. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	on these important seismic properties of hydrocarbon gases and oils

	yield more accurate values of these fluid properties than are typically
	assumed. Simplified expressions are developed to facilitate the use
	of realistic fluid properties in rock models. Pore fluids have properties
	that vary substantially, but systematically, with composition, pressure,
	and temperature. Gas and oil density and modulus, as well as oil
	viscosity, increase with molecular weight and pressure, and decrease
	with temperature. Gas viscosity has a similar behavior, except at
	higher temperatures and lower pressures, where the viscosity will
	increase slightly with increasing temperature. Large amounts of gas
	can go into solution in lighter oils and substantially lower the
	modulus and viscosity. Brine modulus, density, and viscosities increase
	with increasing salt content and pressure. Brine is peculiar because
	the modulus reaches a maximum at a temperature from 40 to 80-degrees-C.
	Far less gas can be absorbed by brines than by light oils. As a result,

Systematic thermogravimetric analyses of urea and its most important by-products, such as biuret and cyanuric acid, are performed to gain the main reactions and their rates. Gaseous products are analyzed and the concentrations of solid products are determined. The reaction scheme, as well as the kinetic parameterization, is validated at different heating rates. The proposed kinetic reaction model matches all performed thermogravimetric analyses and it is also able to reproduce changes in the measurement conditions, such as differences in crucibles geometry or variations of the initial sample mass. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract =  {Currently, many biological substances extracted from algae have received special attention because of their intrinsic characteristics, which can be applied to different areas of biotechnology. Therefore, in the current study, exopolysaccharides (EPS) from the microalgae Cryptomonas tetrapirenoidosa were employed as an aqueous subphase of a monolayer formed by the lipid dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB). The primary objective of this approach was to evaluate whether EPS could serve as a matrix for the immobilization of the enzyme urease to produce biosensors for urea. After DODAB was spread on the EPS solutions, urease was injected into the aqueous subphase, and the surface was submitted to compression using lateral barriers. The monolayers were subsequently characterized by surface pressure-area isotherms and polarization modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). The results indicated that EPS enhanced the adsorption of the enzyme on the lipid monolayer. The mixed films were later transferred to solid supports using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique and were characterized by transfer ratio, PM-IRRAS, quartz crystal microbalance, and atomic force microscopy. The immobilization of the enzyme on solid supports was fundamental for providing an ideal geometrical accommodation of urease because the interaction of EPS with urease in solution causes a decrease of the relative activity of urease. Therefore, these LB films are promising for the fabrication of future urea biosensors, the architecture of which can be manipulated and enhanced at the molecular level.},

Normally, studies of scale formation have been focused on precipitation processes in the bulk solution using bulk jar methods where the precipitation tendency rate and inhibitor effectiveness are quantified. Several recent studies have started to focus on scale deposits formed on the surface of metals. In this paper, calcareous scale formation was studied both in the bulk solution and on the metal surface in three supersaturated scale formation solutions which represent typical waters encountered in oil and gas production. An electrochemical technique, using a rotating disk electrode (RDE), was used to quantify scale formation on the metal surface. With this technique, reduction of oxygen was considered at the surface of a RDE. The rate of oxygen-reduction at the surface of the RDE enables the extent of surface coverage of scale to be assessed. To understand the formation and growth of the surface scale deposit, surface analysis was used in conjunction with this technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for analyzing the microstructure of the scale. At the same time, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used for analyzing the quantity of the precipitate formed in the bulk solution and scale formed on the metal surface by dissolving the scale. In this paper it is demonstrated that bulk precipitation and surface deposition have different dependencies on the index of supersaturation and so to completely understand an industrial scaling system both processes should be studied. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The literature has been critically reviewed in order to assess the
	attenuation processes governing contaminants in leachate affected
	aquifers. Attenuation here refers to dilution, sorption, ion exchange,
	precipitation, redox reactions and degradation processes. With respect
	to contaminants, focus is on dissolved organic matter, xenobiotic
	organic compounds, inorganic macrocomponents as anions and cations,
	and heavy metals. Laboratory as well as field investigations are
	included. This review is an up-date of an earlier comprehensive review.
	The review shows that most leachate contamination plumes are relatively
	narrow and do not in terms of width exceed the width of the landfill.
	The concept of redox zones being present in the plume has been confirmed
	by the reported composition of the leachate contaminated groundwater
	at several landfills and constitutes an important framework for understanding
	the behavior of the contaminants in the plume as the leachate migrates
	away from the landfill. Diverse microbial communities have been identified
	in leachate plumes and are believed to be responsible for the redox
	processes. Dissolved organic C in the leachate, although it appears
	to be only slowly degradable when the volatile organic acids are
	gone, apparently acts as substrate for the microbial redox processes.
	Several xenobiotic organic compounds have been found to be degradable
	in leachate contaminated groundwater, but degradation rates under
	anaerobic redox conditions have only been determined in a few cases.
	Apparently, observations in actual plumes indicate more extensive
	degradation than has been documented in the laboratory. The behavior
	of cations in leachate plumes is strongly influenced by exchange
	with the sediment, although the sediment often is very coarse and
	sandy. Ammonium seems to be subject to anaerobic oxidation, but the
	mechanisms are not yet understood. Heavy metals do not seem to constitute
	a significant pollution problem at landfills, partly because the
	heavy metal concentrations in the leachate often are low, and partly
	because of strong attenuation by sorption and precipitation. Although
	complexation of heavy metals with dissolved organic matter is significant,
	the heavy metals are in most cases still strongly attenuated in leachate-polluted
	aquifers. The information available on attenuation processes has
	increased dramatically during the last 15 a, but the number of well-documented
	full scale leachate plumes are still few and primarily from sandy
	aquifers. Thus, the diversity of attenuation processes in leachate
	plumes is probably not yet fully understood. Apparently, the attenuation
	processes in leachate plumes may for many contaminants provide significant
	natural remediation, limiting the effects of the leachate on the
	groundwater to an area usually not exceeding 1000 m from the landfill.

  abstract = {The presence of an immobile gaseous phase in an otherwise-saturated
	porous medium affects the transport of volatile compounds. The linear
	theory of partitioning tracers suggests that a volatile tracer introduced
	into such a system should be retarded with a constant retardation
	factor. Using high concentrations, however, the saturation of the
	gaseous phase will change as an effect of the tracer test itself.
	Competitive gas transfer among all volatile compounds and the change
	of saturation may lead to tracer concentrations that are temporarily
	higher than those injected. We analyze the system in the framework
	of the coherence theory by Helfferich [Soc. Pet. Eng. J. 21 (1) (1981)
	51]. The governing equations are formulated as functions of total
	concentration, i.e., the mass of solutes in all phases per pore volume.
	Neglecting dispersion and mass-transfer kinetics, we derive the characteristic
	form of the resulting system of hyperbolic equations. In a system
	with N volatile compounds, a variation of the concentrations splits
	up into N waves, each traveling with its own characteristic velocity.
	If the presence of a gaseous phase is sustained, one wave will be
	a standing one. We perform numerical model calculations for tracers
	with various Henry's law coefficients and show that the results agree
	with the semi-analytical solution obtained by coherence theory. Copyright

  abstract = {A major problem preventing widespread implementation of microbial
	injection strategies for bioremediation and/or microbially enhanced
	oil recovery is the tendency of bacteria to strongly adhere to surfaces
	in the immediate vicinity of the injection point. Long term (weeks
	to months) nutrient starvation of bacteria prior to injection can
	decrease attachment and enhance transport through porous media. This
	paper summarizes results of starvation-enhanced transport experiments
	in sand columns of 30 cm, 3 m, and 16 m in length. The 16 m column
	experiments compared transport, breakthrough and distribution of
	adhered cells for starved and vegetative cultures of Klebsiella oxytoca,
	a copious biofilm producer. Results from these experiments were subsequently
	used to design and construct a field-scale biofilm barrier using
	starved Pseudomonas fluorescens. The 30 cm and 3 m sand columns experiments
	investigated starvation-enhanced transport of Shewanella algae BrY,
	a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium. In both cases the vegetative
	cells adsorbed onto the sand in higher numbers than the starved cells,
	especially near the entrance of the column. These results, taken
	together with studies cited in the literature, indicate that starved
	cells penetrate farther (i.e. higher breakthrough concentration)
	and adsorb more uniformly along the flow path than vegetative cells.

Although many computer models have been developed to predict the thermodynamic tendency of scaling, the kinetics have usually been neglected due to a lack of a reliable model to predict how fast the scale will build-up. In this work, the kinetics of calcium carbonate (calcite seeds used) precipitation have been studied by using visual observations of crystal growth within a glass micromodel. The effects of the solution composition, temperature and the presence of a gas-liquid interface on the spontaneous nucleation and the calcite crystal growth rate have been examined. From the measurements of the crystal growth kinetic data, the calcite growth rate constant as a function of temperature (25-70 degrees C) and ionic strength (up to 2 eq/kg) have been determined and an activation energy of 46.9 kJ/mol estimated. We believe that the presence of a gas-liquid interface can help spontaneous nucleation. The presence of Mg2+ at ratios of [Mg2+]/[Ca2+] between 0.1 to 0.5 causes a 50{\%} reduction in calcite growth rate and must not be neglected in scale kinetics. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: $\backslash$n$\backslash$nBACKGROUND: Jack bean urease (EC 3.5.1.5) is a metalloenzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide. The heavy metal ions are common inhibitors to control the rate of the enzymatic urea hydrolysis, which take the Hg2+ as the representative. Hg2+ affects the enzyme activity causing loss of the biological function of the enzyme, which threatens the survival of many microorganism and plants. However, inhibitory kinetics of urease by the low concentration Hg2+ has not been explored fully. In this study, the inhibitory effect of the low concentration Hg2+ on jack bean urease was investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism of Hg2+ inhibition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: According to the kinetic parameters for the enzyme obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plot, it is shown that the Km is equal to 4.6±0.3 mM and Vm is equal to 29.8±1.7 $\mu$mol NH3/min mg. The results show that the inhibition of jack bean urease by Hg2+ at low concentration is a reversible reaction. Equilibrium constants have been determined for Hg2+ binding with the enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complexes (Ki =0.012 $\mu$M). The results show that the Hg2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor. In addition, the kinetics of enzyme inhibition by the low concentration Hg2+ has been studied using the kinetic method of the substrate reaction. The results suggest that the enzyme first reversibly and quickly binds Hg2+ and then undergoes a slow reversible course to inactivation. Furthermore, the rate constant of the forward reactions (k+0) is much larger than the rate constant of the reverse reactions (k-0). By combining with the fact that the enzyme activity is almost completely lost at high concentration, the enzyme is completely inactivated when the Hg2+ concentration is high enough.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Hg2+ has great impacts on the urease activity and the established inhibition kinetics model is suitable.},

  abstract = {Urea-selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has been a leading contender for removal of nitrogen oxides (deNOx) from diesel engine emissions. Despite its advantages, the SCR technology faces some critical detriments to its catalytic performance such as catalyst surface passivation (caused by deposit formation) and consequent stoichiometric imbalance of the urea consumption. Deposit formation deactivates catalytic performance by not only consuming part of the ammonia produced during urea decomposition but also degrading the structural and thermal properties of the catalyst surface. We have characterized the urea thermolysis with and without the urea-SCR catalyst using both spectroscopic (DRIFTS and Raman) and thermal techniques (thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) to identify the deposit components and their corresponding thermal properties. Urea thermolysis exhibits two decomposition stages, involving ammonia generation and consumption, respectively. The decomposition after the second stage leads to the product of melamine complexes, (HNC=NH)x(HNCO) y, that hinder catalytic performance. The presence of catalyst accompanied with a good spray of the urea solution helps to eliminate the second stage. In this work, kinetics of the direct reduction of NOx by urea is determined and the possibility of using additives to the urea solution in order to rejuvenate the catalyst surface and improve its performance will be discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  year = {2009},
  volume = {16},
  pages = {531--538},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Dissolved humic substances (HS) usually
	comprise 50-80\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic
	ecosystems. From a trophic and biogeochemical perspective, HS has
	been considered to be highly refractory and is supposed to accumulate
	in the water. The upsurge of the microbial loop paradigm and the
	studies on HS photo-degradation into labile DOC gave rise to the
	belief that microbial processing of DOC should sustain aquatic food
	webs in humic waters. However, this has not been extensively supported
	by the literature, since most HS and their photo-products are often
	oxidized by microbes through respiration in most nutrient-poor humic
	waters. Here, we review basic concepts, classical studies, and recent
	data on bacterial and photo-degradation of DOC, comparing the rates
	of these processes in highly humic ecosystems and other aquatic ecosystems.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: We based our review on classical and recent
	findings from the fields of biogeochemistry and microbial ecology,
	highlighting some odd results from highly humic Brazilian tropical
	lagoons, which can reach up to 160 mg C L(-1). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
	Highly humic tropical lagoons showed proportionally lower bacterial
	production rates and higher bacterial respiration rates (i.e., lower
	bacterial growth efficiency) than other lakes. Zooplankton showed
	similar delta(13)C to microalgae but not to humic DOC in these highly
	humic lagoons. Thus, the data reviewed here do not support the microbial
	loop as an efficient matter transfer pathway in highly humic ecosystems,
	where it is supposed to play its major role. In addition, we found
	that some tropical humic ecosystems presented the highest potential
	DOC photo-chemical mineralization (PM) rates reported in the literature,
	exceeding up to threefold the rates reported for temperate humic
	ecosystems. We propose that these atypically high PM rates are the
	result of a joint effect of the seasonal dynamics of allochthonous
	humic DOC input to these ecosystems and the high sunlight incidence
	throughout the year. The sunlight action on DOC is positive to microbial
	consumption in these highly humic lagoons, but little support is
	given to the enhancement of bacterial growth efficiency, since the
	labile photo-chemical products are mostly respired by microbes in
	the nutrient-poor humic waters. CONCLUSIONS: HS may be an important
	source of energy for aquatic bacteria in humic waters, but it is
	probably not as important as a substrate to bacterial growth and
	to aquatic food webs, since HS consumption is mostly channeled through
	microbial respiration. This especially seems to be the case of humic-rich,
	nutrient-poor ecosystems, where the microbial loop was supposed to
	play its major role. Highly humic ecosystems also present the highest
	PM rates reported in the literature. Finally, light and bacteria
	can cooperate in order to enhance total carbon degradation in highly
	humic aquatic ecosystems but with limited effects on aquatic food
	webs. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: More detailed studies using
	C- and N-stable isotope techniques and modeling approaches are needed
	to better understand the actual importance of HS to carbon cycling
	in highly humic waters.},

  abstract = {{When representative equations for the viscosity of carbon dioxide
	were published in 1990, it was recognized that, owing to inconsistencies
	among the available experimental liquid viscosity data which could
	not be resolved, new measurements were necessary. Since then, two
	new sets of measurements have been performed and it is appropriate
	to revise the published equations in order to improve their performance
	in the liquid region. In the previous work, the excess viscosity
	was represented by two separate equations, one for the gas phase
	and the other, a provisional one, for the liquid phase. Both equations
	were joined by a blending function. In the present work, the excess
	viscosity for the whole thermodynamic surface is represented by one
	equation. The resulting overall viscosity representation for carbon
	dioxide covers the temperature range 200 K less than or equal to
	T less than or equal to 1500 K and densities up to 1400 kg m(-3).
	In terms of pressure, the viscosity representation is valid up to
	300 MPa for temperatures below 1000 K, whereas for higher temperatures
	and owing to the limitation of the equation of state used, the upper
	pressure limit is restricted to 30 MPa. The uncertainties associated
	with the proposed representation vary from +/-0.3\% for the viscosity
	of the dilute gas near room temperature to +/-5.0\% at the highest
	pressures. Tables of viscosity generated by the representative equations
	are included for easy reference and to assist validation of computer

	rock mineralogy, it might trigger geochemical reactions affecting
	crucial parameters such as porosity (and therefore possibly the sealing
	capacity). To assess this possibility, reactive transport modelling
	including reaction kinetics was performed of dissolved CO2 in the
	cap rock at Sleipner (37 ??C, 101.3??105 Pa). Major geochemical reactions
	between CO2, the cap rock formation water and the cap rock mineralogy
	are identified and the impact on the porosity is calculated. After
	several years of initial carbonate dissolution, feldspar dissolution
	dominates over the subsequent hundreds and thousands of years, with
	the reaction rate strongly depending on plagioclase composition.
	A slight decrease of the porosity is predicted which might improve
	the sealing capacity of the cap rock, but this porosity change will
	be restricted to the lower metres, even for the most reactive case.
	Major uncertainties affecting the accuracy of the modelling are the
	selection of the primary and secondary mineral assemblages for the

  abstract = {This paper presents numerical simulations of reactive transport which
	may be induced in the caprock of an on-shore depleted gas reservoir
	by the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide. The objective
	is to verify that CO2 geological disposal activities currently being
	planned for the study area are safe and do not induce any undesired
	environmental impact. In our model, fluid flow, mass transport and
	mineral alteration are induced in the caprock by penetration of high
	CO2 concentrations from the underlying reservoir, where it was assumed
	that large amounts of CO2 have already been injected at depth. The
	main focus is on the potential effect of precipitation and dissolution
	processes on the sealing efficiency of caprock formations. Concerns
	that some leakage may occur in the investigated system arise because
	the seal is made up of potentially highly-reactive rocks, consisting
	of carbonate-rich shales (calcite + dolomite averaging up to more
	than 30\% of solid volume fraction). Batch simulations and multi-dimensional
	1D and 2D modeling have been used to investigate multicomponent geochemical
	processes. Numerical simulations account for multiphase advection,
	aqueous diffusion, fracture-matrix interactions (advective and diffusive
	exchange of species between fractures and matrix rock), gas phase
	participation in multiphase fluid flow and geochemical reactions,
	and kinetics of fluid-rock interactions. The sensitivity of CO2 concentrations
	to geochemical processes and parameters is investigated by conceptualizing
	different mass transport mechanisms (i.e. diffusion and mixed advection
	+ diffusion). The most relevant mineralogical transformations occurring
	in the caprock are described, and the feedback of these geochemical
	processes on physical properties such as porosity is examined to
	evaluate how the sealing capacity of the caprock could evolve in
	time. The simulations demonstrate that the occurrence of some gas
	leakage from the reservoir may have a strong influence on the geochemical
	evolution of the caprock. In fact, when a free CO2-dominated phase
	migrates into the caprock through pre-existing fractures, or through
	zones with high initial porosity acting as preferential flow paths
	for reservoir fluids, low pH values are predicted, accompanied by
	significant calcite dissolution and porosity enhancement. In contrast,
	when fluid-rock interactions occur under fully liquid-saturated conditions
	and a diffusion-controlled regime, pH will be buffered at higher
	values, and some calcite precipitation is predicted which leads to
	further sealing of the storage reservoir. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

The time dependence of the relative enzymatic activity was found to follow the second order kinetics, which was consistent with pre-equilibrated folding/unfolding of the native enzyme, followed by irreversible cluster-cluster aggregation of the non-native enzyme resulting in gradual and permanent loss of enzymatic activity. Monomer-cluster aggregation scenario was considered but was not consistent with the observed kinetic order of monomer disappearance at longer times. We analysed time evolution of the average hydrodynamic radius obtained from dynamic light scattering measurements and by fitting these data with our model, we were able to estimate the value of the unfolding equilibrium constant with a reasonable accuracy (K c≈0.05 at 80°C). We were also able to make order of magnitude estimates of the maximum number of enzyme molecules in the aggregated clusters (hundreds) as well as the aggregation rate constant of the non-native enzyme. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {Atmospheric pollution and other human activities have altered natural
	element cycles over large regions of the world. Much current understanding
	of nutrient dynamics in temperate region ecosystems has been derived
	from such biogeochemically altered areas. While it is increasingly
	difficult to find regions of temperate forest that can be classified
	as free from human influences, studies of unpolluted and undisturbed
	areas can (1) provide important ''baseline'' information about natural
	patterns of element cycling, against which disturbed cycles can be
	compared; (2) provide insights into the biogeochemical conditions
	that acted as evolutionary and selective constraints on biotic communities
	before the advent of regional-scale human impacts. and (3) provide
	an opportunity to evaluate the general nature of biogeochemical theories
	that have been developed in areas subject to strong human influences.
	We here report on patterns of hydrologic nutrient loss from old-growth
	temperate forest ecosystems in southern Chile based on chemical analyses
	of small streams draining 31 watersheds. These forests have not been
	subject to air pollution inputs and have remained floristically stable
	throughout the Holocene. For major elements our results support predictions
	from current biogeochemical theory (the ''nutrient retention hypothesis'')
	that net biotic retention of elements should be minimal in old-growth
	forest ecosystems. Despite the dilute nature of watershed streams,
	the overall patterns of loss of most elements could be explained
	almost exclusively by atmospheric inputs of marine aerosols. In contrast.
	patterns of nitrogen loss were more complex than predicted by current
	conceptual models. Hydrologic N losses occurred nearly exclusively
	(95\% of total N) as dissolved organic forms of nitrogen (DON), rather
	than as the inorganic forms NO3- (0.2\% of total N) and NH4+ (4.8\%
	of total N). The strong dominance of organic over inorganic losses
	of N indicates that losses of N from old-growth forest ecosystems
	are not exclusively subject to traditional mechanisms of direct biotic
	control (i.e., mineralization supply or biotic uptake), but are also
	subject to indirect biotic control associated with the long-term
	accumulation, humification, and leaching of soil organic N during
	ecosystem succession. The view of unpolluted old-growth forests as
	''leaky'' vs. ''non-leaky'' with respect to N depends on whether
	ecosystem budgets or models consider dissolved organic, as well as
	inorganic, forms of N. High- and mid-elevation forests in our study
	area showed the lowest efflux concentrations of N as NO3- reported
	from any old-growth temperate forest ecosystem (0.10 vs. 0.30 mu
	g/L, respectively). Comparisons against other old-growth forests,
	subject to varying levels of N deposition, indicated that levels
	of NO3- and the relative abundance of NO3- vs. NH4- in Northern Hemisphere
	forests may be strongly influenced by atmospheric N inputs. Our analyses
	suggest that patterns of N cycling, as well as evolutionary selective
	pressures on plant and microbial species, may have changed as a function
	of regional-scale increases in atmospheric N deposition to European
	and North American temperate forests. We hypothesize that, because
	they inherently are more poor than aggrading forests at retaining
	added nutrients, old-growth forest ecosystems are particularly sensitive
	indicators of N deposition.},

abstract={Attachment of bacteria in porous media is a complex mixture of processes resulting in the transfer and immobilization of suspended cells onto a solid surface within the porous medium. Quantifying the rate of attachment is difficult due to the many simultaneous processes possibly involved in attachment, including straining, sorption, and sedimentation, and the difficulties in measuring metabolically active cells attached to porous media. Preliminary experiments confirmed the difficulty associated with measuring active Sporosarcina pasteurii cells attached to porous media. However, attachment is a key process in applications of biofilm-mediated reactions in the subsurface such as microbially induced calcite precipitation. Independent of the exact processes involved, attachment determines both the distribution and the initial amount of attached biomass and as such the initial reaction rate. As direct experimental investigations are difficult, this study is limited to a numerical investigation of the effect of various initial biomass distributions and initial amounts of attached biomass. This is performed for various injection strategies, changing the injection rate as well as alternating between continuous and pulsed injections. The results of this study indicate that, for the selected scenarios, both the initial amount and the distribution of attached biomass have minor influence on the Ca                                                                          {\$}{\$}^{\{}2+{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                                                                      2                          +                                                                                                     precipitation efficiency as well as the distribution of the precipitates compared to the influence of the injection strategy.

The curves exhibited a biphasic pattern in the whole temperature range and they were well fitted with a biexponential model. A simultaneous fit of all inactivation data was based on kinetic models that were derived from different inactivation mechanisms and comprised the material balances of several enzyme forms and the enthalpy balance characterizing the initial heating period of enzyme solution. The multitemperature evaluation revealed that an adequate model had to incorporate at least three reaction steps. It was concluded that the key reaction steps at urease thermal inactivation were the reversible dissociation/denaturation of native form into an inactive denatured form, and irreversible association reactions of both the denatured and native forms.},

With this in view, we studied adsorption kinetics of different phosphonic acids of short chain lengths such as phosphonopropionic acid (PPA), aminobenzylphosphonic acid (ABPA), benzylphosphonic acid (BPA), butylphosphonic acid (BuPA), and a long chain decylphosphonic acid (DecPA) on ITO surface using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at short and long time scales. The dependence of solution concentration on formation kinetics is studied and the existences of two discrete kinetics were revealed. We show from our studies that the rate of adsorption is controlled by diffusion at small time scales.

  abstract = {Laboratory experiments have definitively shown that exopolymer-producing
	bacteria have the potential to modify the flow of fluids in oil reservoirs
	to enhance oil production. Once injected into the reservoir, they
	will be subjected to a wide range of pH values and to starvation
	resulting from nutrient depletion. For successful field implementation
	it is necessary to have a fundamental understanding of these effects
	on the viability of bacteria. This paper addresses the effects of
	pH and trace minerals on cell viability of Leuconostoc mesenteroides
	during carbon source depletion. Two different carbon sources were
	used to grow cells before transferring the cells to starvation conditions:
	sucrose and a combination of glucose and fructose. These substrates
	were chosen because L. mesenteroides produces a significant amount
	of water-insoluble exopolymers (dextran) under sucrose-fed conditions,
	which may enhance cell survival under harsh conditions. The effects
	of dextran on the cell viability were tested at different pH values
	with and without trace minerals. The rate of cell death followed
	an exponential-decay law for different values of the solution pH.
	The optimal solution pH for survival was pH 5, whereas cells died
	rapidly at pH 3 and below and at pH 13 and above. The sucrose-fed
	cells showed a greater viability than cells fed glucose and fructose
	for all pH ranges tested. The results indicated that water-insoluble
	exopolymers help cells survive for longer periods of time under starvation
	conditions. The effects of trace minerals on cell culturability were
	tested at two pH values, 4.5 and 7. For both cases, cells showed
	a greater culturability (smaller decay rate constant) in the presence
	of trace minerals than without trace minerals. It was also found
	that the effects of trace minerals on cell culturability were greater
	for glucose-fructose-fed cells than for sucrose-fed cells. The Michaelis
	pH function theory was used for comparing the relationships between
	the cell decay rate and pH.},

	Soil clogging by an excessive growth of bacteria is often accompanied

	hydraulic conductivity were concurrently characterized at two flow
	rates and two levels of substrate concentrations. The experiments
	were conducted using a biofilm flow cell that was filled with glass
	beads. The biofilm images taken by confocal laser scanning microscopy

	biofilm density and clogging rate. Three different clogging mechanisms
	were suggested depending on the flow rate and substrate concentration:
	(1) clogging at a high flow rate can be accelerated by entrapped
	and accumulated biofilms, and can be easily eliminated by high shear
	force, (2) clogging at a low flow rate can be delayed for the time
	of local biofilm growths in the narrow pore necks, but the biofilm
	is rigid enough not to be sloughed, and (3) clogging in a solution
	with high substrate concentrations cannot be easily eliminated because

The best immobilization obtained were 77{\%} and 54{\%} for chitosan and alginate, respectively. A 2{\%} chitosan solution (w/v) was used to form beads in 1N KOH. The beads were activated with 1{\%} glutaraldehyde and 0.5 mg protein was immobilized per ml of chitosan gel for optimum results. The activation and coupling time were 6 h and 12 h, respectively. Further, alginate and soluble urease were mixed to form beads and final concentrations of alginate and protein in beads were 3.5{\%} (w/v) and 0.5 mg/5 ml gel. From steady-state kinetics, the optimum temperature for urease was 65 ??C (soluble), 75 ??C (chitosan) and 80 ??C (alginate). The activation energies were found to be 3.68 kcal mol-1, 5.02 kcal mol-1, 6.45 kcal mol-1 for the soluble, chitosan- and alginate-immobilized ureases, respectively. With time-dependent thermal inactivation studies, the immobilized urease showed improved stability at 75 ??C and the t1/2 of decay in urease activity was 12 min, 43 min and 58 min for soluble, alginate and chitosan, respectively. The optimum pH of urease was 7, 6.2 and 7.9 for soluble, alginate and chitosan, respectively. A significant change in Km value was noticed for alginate-immobilized urease (5.88 mM), almost twice that of soluble urease (2.70 mM), while chitosan showed little change (3.92 mM). The values of Vmax for alginate-, chitosan-immobilized ureases and soluble urease were 2.82 ?? 102 ??mol NH3 min-1 mg-1 protein, 2.65 ?? 102 ??mol NH3 min-1 mg-1 protein and 2.85 ?? 102 ??mol NH3 min-1 mg-1 protein, respectively. By contrast, reusability studies showed that chitosan-urease beads can be used almost 14 times with only 20{\%} loss in original activity while alginate-urease beads lost 45{\%} of activity after same number of uses. Immobilized urease showed improved stability when stored at 4 ??C and t1/2 of urease was found to be 19 days, 80 days and 121 days, respectively for soluble, alginate and chitosan ureases. The immobilized urease was used to estimate the blood urea in clinical samples. The results obtained with the immobilized urease were quite similar to those obtained with the autoanalyzer??.

This urease coupled hydrogel (UCG) was obtained by amine-acid coupling reaction and this procedure is such that it ensured the wider opening of mobile flap of enzyme active site. A systematic comparison of urea-urease assay and the detailed kinetic data clearly revealed that the urease shows activity for more than a month when stored at {\~{}}27-30. °C in case of UCG whereas it becomes inactive in case of free urease (enzyme in buffer solution). The aqueous microenvironment inside the hydrogel, unusual morphological features and thermal behaviour were believed to be the reasons for unexpected behaviour. UCG displayed enzyme activity at basic pH and up to 60. °C. UCG showed significant enhancement in activity against thermal degradation compared to free urease. In summary, this method is a suitable process to stabilize the biomacromolecules in standard room temperature for many practical uses.},

	an important role in both geological processes and engineering practices.
	Numerical models have been developed to investigate the evolution
	of the chemical dissolution front within a fluid-saturated porous
	medium. In these models, several permeability???porosity relationships
	have been proposed and incorporated into the numerical model for
	describing simultaneous changes in permeability and porosity induced
	by mineral dissolution, but limited experimental data are available
	to justify one form superior to the other. This study investigates
	the effects of the permeability???porosity relationships on the morphological
	evolution of the chemical dissolution front. Three porosity???permeability
	relationships, namely, modified Fair???Hatch, Kozeny???Carman and
	Verma???Pruess (VP) models are incorporated into the numerical model.
	A series of numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the morphological
	evolution of reaction front, and the corresponding behaviour diagrams
	are constructed. Results shows that the morphological development
	are similar each other for modified Fair???Fatch and Kozeny???Carman
	model. The VP model yields a relative low primary and secondary critical
	upstream pressure gradient value owing to the flow-focusing effect
	enhanced by the stronger dependence of permeability on porosity.
	A comparison of behaviour diagrams of front morphology among three
	relationships show that the double-fingering front occurs under condition
	of lower upstream pressure gradient and smaller non-uniformity spacing
	for VP model. Our simulations demonstrate that the choice of the
	permeability???porosity function plays important roles on the evolution
	patterns of dissolution front. Therefore, an adequate description
	of the permeability???porosity relationship may lead to a more realistic

	evasion, particle scavenging, and deep ocean burial). Instead, consistency
	with two observed atmospheric distributions was required: the interhemispheric

	of various reservoirs, and vertical exchange between the surface
	ocean and the permanent thermocline. Results of the model indicate:
	lower evasional fluxes of Hg from the global ocean than previous

  abstract = {The metabolism of urea by urease enzymes of oral bacteria profoundly
	influences oral biofilm pH homeostasis and oral microbial ecology.
	The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the regulation
	of expression of the low pH-inducible urease genes in populations
	of Streptococcus salivarius growing in vitro in biofilms and to explore
	whether urease regulation or the levels of urease expression in biofilm
	cells differed significantly from planktonic cells. Two strains of
	S. salivarius harbouring urease promoter fusions to a chloramphenicol
	acetyltransferase (cat) gene were used: PurelCAT, containing a fusion
	to the full-length, pH-sensitive promoter; or Pureldelta100CAT, a
	constitutively derepressed deletion derivative of the urease gene
	promoter. The strains were grown in a Rototorque biofilm reactor
	in a tryptone-yeast extract-sucrose medium with or without pH control.
	Both CAT and urease activities in biofilms were measured at 'quasi-steady
	state' and after a 25mM glucose pulse. The results showed that CAT
	expression in PurelCAT was repressed at relatively neutral pH values,
	and that expression could be induced by acidic pH after carbohydrate
	challenge. Biofilms of PurelCAT grown at low pH, without buffering,
	had about 20-fold higher CAT levels, and only a modest further induction
	could be elicited with carbohydrate pulsing. The levels of CAT in
	biofilms of PurelCAT grown in buffered medium were slightly higher
	than those reported for planktonic cells cultured at pH 7.0, and
	the levels of CAT in Purel-CAT growing at low pH or after induction
	were similar to those reported for fully induced planktonic cells.
	CAT activity in Pureldelta100CAT was constitutively high, regardless
	of growth conditions. Interestingly, urease activity detected in
	biofilms of the parent strain, S. salivarius 57.1, could be as much
	as 130-fold higher than that reported for fluid chemostat cultures
	grown under similar conditions. The higher level of urease activity
	in biofilms was probably caused by the accumulation of the stable

  abstract = {Geochemical reaction rate laws are often measured using crushed minerals
	in well-mixed laboratory systems that are designed to eliminate mass
	transport limitations. Such rate laws are often used directly in
	reactive transport models to predict the reaction and transport of
	chemical species in consolidated porous media found in subsurface
	environments. Due to the inherent heterogeneities of porous media,
	such use of lab-measured rate laws may introduce errors, leading
	to a need to develop methods for upscaling reaction rates. In this
	work, we present a methodology for using pore-scale network modeling
	to investigate scaling effects in geochemical reaction rates. The
	reactive transport processes are simulated at the pore scale, accounting
	for heterogeneities of both physical and mineral properties. Mass
	balance principles are then used to calculate reaction rates at the
	continuum scale. To examine the scaling behavior of reaction kinetics,
	these continuum-scale rates from the network model are compared to
	the rates calculated by directly using laboratory-measured reaction
	rate laws and ignoring pore-scale heterogeneities. In this work,
	this methodology is demonstrated by upscaling anorthite and kaolinite
	reaction rates under simulation conditions relevant to geological
	CO2 sequestration. Simulation results show that under conditions
	with CO2 present at high concentrations, pore-scale concentrations
	of reactive species and reaction rates vary spatially by orders of
	magnitude, and the scaling effect is significant. With a much smaller
	CO2 concentration, the scaling effect is relatively small. These
	results indicate that the increased acidity associated with geological
	sequestration can generate conditions for which proper scaling tools
	are yet to be developed. This work demonstrates the use of pore-scale
	network modeling as a valuable research tool for examining upscaling
	of geochemical kinetics. The pore-scale model allows the effects
	of pore-scale heterogeneities to be integrated into system behavior
	at multiple scales, thereby identifying important factors that contribute
	to the scaling effect. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The possibility that gradients in concentration may develop within
	single pores and fractures, potentially giving rise to scale-dependent
	mineral dissolution rates, was investigated with experimentally validated
	reactive transport modeling. Three important subsurface mineral phases
	that dissolve at widely different rates, calcite, plagioclase, and
	iron hydroxide, were considered. Two models for analyzing mineral
	dissolution kinetics within a single pore were developed: (1) a Poiseuille
	Flow model that applies laboratory-measured dissolution kinetics
	at the pore or fracture wall and couples this to a rigorous treatment
	of both advective and diffusive transport within the pore, and (2)
	a Well-Mixed Reactor model that assumes complete mixing within the
	pore, while maintaining the same reactive surface area, average flow
	rate, geometry, and multicomponent chemistry as the Poiseuille Flow
	model. For the case of a single fracture, a 1D Plug Flow Reactor
	model was also considered to quantify the effects of longitudinal
	versus transverse mixing. Excellent agreement was obtained between
	results from the Poiseuille Flow model and microfluidic laboratory
	experiments in which pH 4 and 5 solutions were flowed through a single
	500 ??m diameter by 4000 ??m long cylindrical pore in calcite. The
	numerical modeling and time scale analysis indicated that rate discrepancies
	arise primarily where concentration gradients develop under two necessary
	conditions: (1) comparable rates of reaction and advective transport,
	and (2) incomplete mixing via molecular diffusion. For plagioclase
	and iron hydroxide, the scaling effects are negligible at the single
	pore and fracture scale because of their slow rates. In the case
	of calcite, where dissolution rates are rapid, scaling effects can
	develop at high flow rates from 0.1 to 1000 cm/s and for fracture
	lengths less than 1 cm. Under more normal flow conditions where flow
	is usually slower than 0.001 cm/s, however, mixing via molecular
	diffusion is effective in homogenizing the concentration field, thus
	eliminating any discrepancies between the Poiseuille Flow and the
	Well-Mixed Reactor model. The analysis suggests that concentration
	gradients are unlikely to develop within single pores and fractures
	under typical geological/hydrologic conditions, implying that the
	discrepancy between laboratory and field rates must be attributed

  abstract = {Electron donor amendment for bioremediation often results in precipitation
	of secondary minerals and the growth of biomass, both of which can
	potentially change flow paths and the efficacy of bioremediation.
	Quantitative estimation of precipitate and biomass distribution has
	remained challenging, partly due to the intrinsic heterogeneities
	of natural porous media and the scarcity of field data. In this work,
	we examine the effects of physical and geochemical heterogeneities
	on the spatial distributions of mineral precipitates and biomass
	accumulated during a biostimulation field experiment near Rifle,
	Colorado. Field bromide breakthrough data were used to infer a heterogeneous
	distribution of hydraulic conductivity through inverse transport
	modeling, while the solid phase Fe(III) content was determined by
	assuming a negative correlation with hydraulic conductivity. Validated
	by field aqueous geochemical data, reactive transport modeling was
	used to explicitly keep track of the growth of the biomass and to
	estimate the spatial distribution of precipitates and biomass. The
	results show that the maximum mineral precipitation and biomass accumulation
	occurs in the vicinity of the injection wells, occupying up to 5.4
	vol.\% of the pore space, and is dominated by reaction products of
	sulfate reduction. Accumulation near the injection wells is not strongly
	affected by heterogeneities present in the system due to the ubiquitous
	presence of sulfate in the groundwater. However, accumulation in
	the down-gradient regions is dominated by the iron-reducing reaction
	products, whose spatial patterns are strongly controlled by both
	physical and geochemical heterogeneities. Heterogeneities can lead
	to localized large accumulation of mineral precipitates and biomass,
	increasing the possibility of pore clogging. Although ignoring the
	heterogeneities of the system can lead to adequate prediction of
	the average behavior of sulfate-reducing related products, it can
	also lead to an overestimation of the overall accumulation of iron-reducing
	bacteria, as well as the rate and extent of iron reduction. Surprisingly,
	the model predicts that the total amount of uranium being reduced
	in the heterogeneous 2D system was similar to that in the 1D homogeneous
	system, suggesting that the overall uranium bioremediation efficacy
	may not be significantly affected by the heterogeneities of Fe(III)
	content in the down-gradient regions. Rather, the characteristics
	close to the vicinity of the injection wells might be crucial in
	determining the overall efficacy of uranium bioremediation. These
	findings have important implications not only for uranium bioremediation
	at the Rifle site and for bioremediation of other redox sensitive
	contaminants at sites with similar characteristics, but also for
	the development of optimal amendment delivery strategies in other

  abstract =  {The composition of carbonate minerals formed in past and present oceans is assumed to be significantly controlled by temperature and seawater composition. To determine if and how temperature is kinetically responsible for the amount of Mg incorporated in calcite, we quantified the influence of temperature and specific dissolved components on the complex mechanism of calcite precipitation in seawater. A kinetic study was carried out in artificial seawater and NaCl-CaCl2 solutions, each having a total ionic strength of 0.7 M. The constant addition technique was used to maintain [Ca2+] at 10.5 mmol kg-1 while [CO32 -] was varied to isolate the role of this variable on the precipitation rate of calcite. Our results show that the overall reaction of calcite precipitation in both seawater and NaCl-CaCl2 solutions is dominated by the following reaction:. Ca2 + + CO32 - over(↔, kb, kf) Ca CO3where kf and kb are the forward and backward reaction rate constants, respectively, while the net precipitation rate R, can be described at any temperature by. R = kf fenced(aCa2 +)n1 fenced(aCO32 -)n2 - kbor in its logarithmic form. Log (R + kb) = Log Kf + n2 Log [CO32 -]where ni are the partial reaction orders with respect to the participating ions, a the ion activity, $\gamma$ the activity coefficients, and Kf = kf (aCa2 +)n1 ($\gamma$CO32 -)n2 is a constant at a given temperature. We find that, irrespective of the presence of Mg, SO4, and other specific seawater components known calcite reaction rate inhibitors, the partial reaction order with respect to carbonate ion concentration changes from 2 to 5 while the rate constant Kf, increases by 3-4 orders of magnitude when temperature varies from 5 to 70 °C. The observed variations of the kinetic mechanism resulting from the temperature changes are correlated with the variable amount of Mg incorporated in the formed calcites. Moreover, at a given temperature, the increase in the saturation state enhances the rate of calcite precipitation without influencing the reaction mechanism and without changing the amount of Mg incorporated in the growing lattice. Thus, the results of this experimental study are consistent with present-day abiotic marine carbonates where low-Mg calcite cements are mainly associated with cool water while high-Mg carbonates are dominantly found in warm-water environments. This suggests that the apparent inverse relationship between the global average paleo-temperature and the Mg/Ca ratio in past formed marine carbonate may correspond to major changes in seawater saturation state or (Mg/Ca) ratios that in turn should reflect significant changes in the relative seawater geochemical cycles of these cations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	Metabolically active microorganisms can be recovered from a diversity

	as microorganisms do in surface sediments, but at much slower rates.
	The technical difficulties in aseptically sampling deep subsurface
	sediments and the fact that microbial processes in laboratory incubations

	frequently necessitate that microbial activity in the deep subsurface
	be inferred through nonmicrobiological analyses of ground water.
	These approaches include measurements of dissolved H2, which can

	bacteria fraction of the total input mass retained that results in
	a 5 log removal were extrapolated. Low values of $\alpha$(L) in the
	order 10(-4) and 10(-3) were obtained for UCFL-94 and UCFL-131 respectively,
	while $\alpha$(i)-values ranged between 10(-6) to 10(-3) for UCFL-94

	from experiments with both short (<1m) and long columns (>25 m).
	Also variable values of sticking efficiencies within and among the

  abstract = {The field of reactive transport modeling has expanded significantly
	in the past two decades and has assisted in resolving many issues
	in Earth Sciences. Numerical models allow for detailed examination
	of coupled transport and reactions, or more general investigation
	of controlling processes over geologic time scales. Reactive transport
	models serve to provide guidance in field data collection and, in
	particular, enable researchers to link modeling and hydrogeochemical
	studies. In this state-of-science review, the key objectives were
	to examine the applicability of reactive transport codes for exploring
	issues of redox stability to depths of several hundreds of meters
	in sparsely fractured crystalline rock, with a focus on the Canadian
	Shield setting. A conceptual model of oxygen ingress and redox buffering,
	within a Shield environment at time and space scales relevant to
	nuclear waste repository performance, is developed through a review
	of previous research. This conceptual model describes geochemical
	and biological processes and mechanisms materially important to understanding
	redox buffering capacity and radionuclide mobility in the far-field.
	Consistent with this model, reactive transport codes should ideally
	be capable of simulating the effects of changing recharge water compositions
	as a result of long-term climate change, and fracture-matrix interactions
	that may govern water-rock interaction. Other aspects influencing
	the suitability of reactive transport codes include the treatment
	of various reaction and transport time scales, the ability to apply
	equilibrium or kinetic formulations simultaneously, the need to capture
	feedback between water-rock interactions and porosity-permeability
	changes, and the representation of fractured crystalline rock environments
	as discrete fracture or dual continuum media. A review of modern
	multicomponent reactive transport codes indicates a relatively high-level
	of maturity. Within the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal program,
	reactive transport codes of varying complexity have been applied
	to investigate the migration of radionuclides and the geochemical
	evolution of host rock around the planned disposal facility. Through
	appropriate near- and far-field application of dual continuum codes,
	this example demonstrates how reactive transport models have been
	applied to assist in constraining historic water infiltration rates,

  abstract = {Redox evolution in sparsely fractured crystalline rocks is a key,
	and largely unresolved, issue when assessing the geochemical suitability
	of deep geological repositories for nuclear waste. Redox zonation
	created by the influx of oxygenated waters has previously been simulated
	using reactive transport models that have incorporated a variety
	of processes, resulting in predictions for the depth of oxygen penetration
	that may vary greatly. An assessment and direct comparison of the
	various underlying conceptual models are therefore needed. In this
	work a reactive transport model that considers multiple processes
	in an integrated manner is used to investigate the ingress of oxygen
	for both single fracture and fracture zone scenarios. It is shown
	that the depth of dissolved oxygen migration is greatly influenced
	by the a priori assumptions that are made in the conceptual models.
	For example, the ability of oxygen to access and react with minerals
	in the rock matrix may be of paramount importance for single fracture
	conceptual models. For fracture zone systems, the abundance and reactivity
	of minerals within the fractures and thin matrix slabs between the
	fractures appear to provide key controls on O(2) attenuation. The
	findings point to the need for improved understanding of the coupling
	between the key transport-reaction feedbacks to determine which conceptual
	models are most suitable and to provide guidance for which parameters
	should be targeted in field and laboratory investigations.},

An increase of the total porosity ($\phi$T) accompanied by a persistent permeability (k) decrease was measured. The mechanisms controlling this atypical anticorrelated k − $\phi$T relationship were investigated from the analysis of high-resolution X-ray microtomography images of the sample acquired before and after the experiment. All the evidences converge to the conclusion that the ubiquitous decrease of permeability measured during the 44 h of dissolution is due to the clogging of a fraction of the macroporosity by microporous material triggered by the rearrangement of the detached undissolved particles. This mechanism results in the development of low permeability zones bridging the macroporosity.},

	fate and transport model parameters describing breakthrough curves
	(BTCs) obtained through porous media column studies, and is applied
	to data involving different ionic strength solutions to fit models
	of differing complexity. Our approach focuses on the simultaneous
	fitting of a number of BTCs representing different conditions, and
	it provides a measure of the goodness of model structure, namely
	Deviance Information Criteria (DIC). Comparison of DIC per model
	fit enables the evaluation of the significance of various processes
	through step-wise increases in complexity due to the addition of
	process model components. We use the method to investigate the transport
	of both flagellated and non-flagellated strains of Azotobacter vinelandii
	in a simulated porous media under three ionic strengths. Three different
	model structures are considered: one without a detachment process
	and with Langmuirian blocking function, one with detachment, and
	one with detachment and a second-order blocking function based on
	random sequential adsorption. First, the model was applied separately
	to each single BTC. Next, the model was applied comprehensively to
	the experiments under various ionic strengths, whereas some transport
	parameters including dispersivity, detachment coefficient, the fraction
	of cells undergoing irreversible attachment, and the coefficient
	of the second-order blocking term were assumed to be the same under
	different ionic strengths. In most cases, including detachment substantially
	improved the DIC as expected, whereas using the second-order blocking
	improved DIC for most of the cases when the method was applied to
	separate BTCs but not when the method was applied collectively to
	the three BTCs obtained under various ionic strengths. Also, comparing
	the outcomes of the separate applications of the parameter estimation
	algorithm versus the collective application indicates that the uncertainty
	associated with the estimated parameters is substantially smaller
	when the collective approach is used and also that the estimated

  abstract = {{Supercritical CO2 has been shown to act as a disinfectant against
	microorganisms. These organisms have most often been tested in vegetative
	or spore form. Since biofilm organisms are typically more resilient
	to physical, chemical, and biological stresses than the same organisms
	in planktonic form, they are often considered more difficult to eradicate.
	it is therefore hypothesized that supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) induced
	inactivation of biofilm organisms would be less effective than against
	planktonic (suspended) growth cultures of the same organism. Six-day
	old biofilm cultures as well as suspended planktonic cultures of
	Bacillus mojavensis were exposed to flowing SC-CO2 at 136 atm and
	35 degrees C for 19 min and slowly depressurized after treatment.
	After SC-CO2 exposure, B. mojavensis samples were analyzed for total
	and viable cells. Suspended cultures revealed a 3 log(10) reduction
	while biofilm cultures showed a 1 log(10) reduction in viable cell
	numbers. These data demonstrate that biofilm cultures of B. mojavensis
	are more resilient to SC-CO2 than suspended planktonic communities.
	It is hypothesized that the small reduction in the viability of biofilm
	microorganisms reflects the protective effects of extracellular polymeric
	substances (EPS) which make up the biofilm matrix, which offer mass
	transport resistance, a large surface area, and a number of functional
	groups for interaction with and immobilization Of CO2. The resistance
	of biofilm suggests that higher pressures, longer durations Of SC-CO2
	exposure, and a quicker depressurization rate may be required to
	eradicate biofilms during the sterilization of heat-sensitive materials
	in medical and industrial applications. However, the observed resilience
	of biofilms to SC-CO2 is particularly promising for the prospective
	application of subsurface biofilms in the subsurface geologic sequestration

  abstract =      {The effects of calcite precipitation on porous media permeability and flow were evaluated with a combined experimental and modeling approach. X-ray microtomography images of two columns packed with glass beads and calcite (spar crystals) or aragonite (Bahamas ooids) injected with a supersaturated solution (log ?? = 1.42) were processed in order to calculate rates of calcite precipitation with a spatial resolution of 4.46 ??m. Identification and localization of the newly precipitated crystals on the 3D images was performed and results used to calculate the crystal growth rates and velocities. The effects of carbonate precipitation were also evaluated in terms of the integrated precipitation rate over the length of the column, crystal shape, surface area and pore roughness changes. While growth was epitaxial on calcite spar, calcite rhombohedra formed on glass beads and clusters of polyhedrons formed on aragonite ooids. Near the column inlet, calcite precipitation occurred preferentially on carbonate grains compared to glass beads, with almost 100{\%} of calcite spar surface area covered by new crystals versus 92{\%} in the case of aragonite and 11{\%} in the case of glass beads. Although the experimental chemistry and flow boundary conditions in the two columns were similar, their porosity-permeability evolution was different because the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth on the two substrates (i.e., calcite spar and aragonite ooids) was very different. The impact of mineral precipitation on pore-scale flow and permeability was evaluated using a pore-scale Stokes solver that accounted for the changes in pore geometry. For similar magnitude reductions in porosity, the decrease in permeability was highest within the sample that experienced the greatest increase in pore roughness. Various porous media models were generated to show the impact of different crystal growth patterns and pore roughness changes on flow and permeability-porosity relationship. Under constant flow rate boundary conditions, precipitation resulted in an increase in both the average and maximum velocities. Increases in pore roughness led to a more heterogeneous flow field, principally through the effects on the fastest and slowest velocities within the domain.},

  abstract = {A long-term (up to 10ka) geochemical change in saline aquifer CO2 storage was studied using the TOUGHREACT simulator, on a 2-dimensional, 2-layered model representing the underground geologic and hydrogeologic conditions of the Tokyo Bay area that is one of the areas of the largest CO2 emissions in the world. In the storage system characterized by low permeability of reservoir and cap rock, the dominant storage mechanism is found to be solubility trapping that includes the dissolution and dissociation of injected CO2 in the aqueous phase followed by geochemical reactions to dissolve minerals in the rocks. The CO2-water-rock interaction in the storage system (mainly in the reservoir) changes the properties of water in a mushroom-like CO2 plume, which eventually leads to convective mixing driven by gravitational instability. The geochemically evolved aqueous phase precipitates carbonates in the plume front due to a local rise in pH with mixing of unaffected reservoir water. The carbonate precipitation occurs extensively within the plume after the end of its enlargement, fixing injected CO2 in a long, geologic period.Dawsonite, a Na-Al carbonate, is initially formed throughout the plume from consumption of plagioclase in the reservoir rock, but is found to be a transient phase finally disappearing from most of the CO2-affected part of the system. The mineral is unstable relative to more common types of carbonates in the geochemical evolution of the CO2 storage system initially having formation water of relatively low salinity. The exception is the reservoir-cap rock boundary where CO2 saturation remains very high throughout the simulation period. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	at constant temperature (25°C) and ionic strength with varying amounts

	that the rate of ureolysis (k(urea)) increases with bacterial cell
	concentration, and the bacterial cell concentration had a greater
	influence on k(urea) than initial urea concentration. At 25 mM Ca(2+)
	concentration, increasing bacterial cell concentration from 10(6)

	by over 30\%. However, when the Ca(2+) concentration was increased
	10-fold to 250 mM Ca(2+), the amount of CaCO(3) precipitated and
	CO(2) sequestrated increased by over 100\% irrespective of initial

	CaCO(3) deposition is achievable with higher concentrations of urea,

Concentrations of thiosulfinates, the compounds responsible for the inhibition, were determined in studied materials. The kinetics and mechanism of the inhibitions were investigated. Biphasic, time-dependent courses of the inhibition reactions were observed for all tested Allium and Brussels sprouts from Brassica. The cabbage material caused the monophasic course of the inhibition. In the presence of dithiothreitol, a total reactivation of the inhibited urease proceeded for the tested plants except for the onion. The onion juice modified urease, regained only half of the initial activity. The irreversible contribution was related to the presence of 1-propanethial-S-oxide, cepaenes and zwiebelanes formed in the onion juice. It was found that the thermal processing of the plant juices, results in the decrease of thiosulfinates concentration, as well as the efficiency of urease inhibition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	on the microbiology of deep subterranean environments, deeper than
	50-100 m. Included are mainly studies where drilling, excavation,
	core sampling and ground water sampling have been made for research.
	Studies done in environments penetrated for commercial purposes,
	such as water wells, mining, oil recovery etc., have been dismissed
	because of the obvious risk for contamination during the penetration.
	Different measures that can be applied to reduce the risk of microbial
	contamination of sampled specimens by the access operations are discussed.
	The requirement for reliable estimations of the present microbial
	biomass, its activity and diversity in subterranean ecosystems, is
	fundamental. An array of different methods to achieve this goal are
	presented. The depth limit for subterranean life is suggested to
	be set by temperature, provided there is energy available for microbial
	life. If so, it should be possible to enrich thermophilic bacteria
	from deep hot ground waters which also has been done. There are only
	a few sites where the subterranean microbiology has been studied
	in multidisiplinary programs including chemistry and geology. The
	two most extensively published sites are the sediments of the Atlantic
	coastal plain of South Carolina, USA, studied in a subsurface program,
	initiated and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, and crystalline
	bed-rock in Sweden studied in a program concerning the safety of
	future underground repositories for nuclear waste. This review presents
	an array of independent reports suggesting that microbial life is
	widespread at depth in the crust of earth--the deep subterranean
	biosphere. The obvious consequences is that microbes may be involved
	in many subterranean geochemical processes, such as diagenesis, weathering,
	precipitation, and in oxidation or reduction reactions of metals,
	carbon, nitrogen and sulfur--just as they are in most terranean environments.},

  abstract = {In 1987, microbiology became a part of the Swedish scientific program
	for the safe disposal of high level nuclear waste (HLW). The goal
	of the microbiology program is to understand how subterranean microorganisms
	will interact with the performance of a future HLW repository. The
	Swedish research program on subterranean microbiology has mainly
	been performed at two sites in granitic rock aquifers at depths ranging
	from 70 m down to 1240 m, the Stripa research mine in the middle
	of Sweden and the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) situated on the
	south eastern coast of Sweden. Some work has also been performed
	in cooperation with other national or international research groups
	in Sweden, Canada and at the natural analogue sites Oklo in Gabon
	and Maqarin in Jordan. The following conclusions are drawn. There
	is a very high probability of the existence of a deep subterranean
	biosphere in granitic rock. The documented presence of a deep biosphere
	implies that relevant microbial reactions should be included in the
	performance assessment for a HLW repository. A HLW repository will
	be situated in a subterranean biosphere that is independent of solar
	energy and photosynthetically produced organic carbon. The ultimate
	limitation for an active microbial life will be the availability
	of hydrogen as energy source over time, and hydrogen has indeed been
	found in most deep groundwaters. Sulphide producing microorganisms
	are active in environments typical for a Swedish HLW repository,
	and the potential for microbial corrosion of the copper canisters
	must be considered. The bentonite buffer around the copper canisters
	will be a hostile environment for most microbes due to the combination
	of radiation, heat and low water availability. Discrete microbial
	species can cope with each of these constraints, and it is theoretically
	possible that sulphide producing microbes may be active inside a
	buffer, although the experiments conducted thus far have shown the
	opposite. Microorganisms have the capability to enzymatically recombine
	radiolysis oxidants formed by radiation of water. It has earlier
	been concluded that the migration of radionuclides due to sorption
	on microorganisms can be neglected. The influence of microbially
	produced complexing agents remains to be studied at realistic conditions
	in deep groundwater. Microorganisms have been found in natural alkaline
	groundwaters, but it could not be conclusively demonstrated that
	they were in situ viable and growing, rather than just transported
	there from neutral groundwater. A possible hypothesis based on the
	obtained results from investigations of natural alkaline groundwaters
	is that fresh concrete may be a bit too extreme for active life even
	for the most adaptable microbe - but this remains to be demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Mitigation strategies for sealing high permeability regions in cap
	rocks, such as fractures or improperly abandoned wells, are important
	considerations in the long term security of geologically stored carbon
	dioxide (CO(2)). Sealing technologies using low-viscosity fluids
	are advantageous in this context since they potentially reduce the
	necessary injection pressures and increase the radius of influence
	around injection wells. Using aqueous solutions and suspensions that
	can effectively promote microbially induced mineral precipitation
	is one such technology. Here we describe a strategy to homogenously
	distribute biofilm-induced calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) precipitates
	in a 61 cm long sand-filled column and to seal a hydraulically fractured,
	74 cm diameter Boyles Sandstone core. Sporosarcina pasteurii biofilms
	were established and an injection strategy developed to optimize
	CaCO(3) precipitation induced via microbial urea hydrolysis. Over
	the duration of the experiments, permeability decreased between 2
	and 4 orders of magnitude in sand column and fractured core experiments,
	respectively. Additionally, after fracture sealing, the sandstone
	core withstood three times higher well bore pressure than during
	the initial fracturing event, which occurred prior to biofilm-induced
	CaCO(3) mineralization. These studies suggest biofilm-induced CaCO(3)
	precipitation technologies may potentially seal and strengthen fractures
	to mitigate CO(2) leakage potential.},

	via urea hydrolysis (ureolysis) is examined for improving construction

	have been researched to spatially and temporally control precipitation.
	This review discusses how optimization of MICP is attempted for different

Urea wastewater treatment loop is based on combined thermal hydrolysis-desorption operations. The wastewater of urea plant includes ammonia and urea which in the current treatment loop; urea decomposes to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The catalytic hydrogen-permselective membrane reactor is proposed for hydrogen production from desorbed ammonia of urea wastewater which much of it discharges to air and causes environmental pollution. Therefore hydrogen is produced from decomposition of ammonia on nickel-alumina catalyst bed simultaneously and permeates from reaction side to shell side through thin layer of palladium-silver membrane. Also a sweep gas is used in the shell side for increasing driving force. In this way, 4588 tons/yr hydrogen is produced and environmental problem of urea plant is solved. The membrane reactor and urea wastewater treatment loop are modeled mathematically and the predicted data of the model are consistent with the experimental and plant data that show validity of the model. Also the effects of key parameters on the performance of catalytic hydrogen-permselective membrane reactor such as the temperature, pressure, thickness of Pd-Ag layer, configuration of flow and sweep gas flow ratio were examined. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments were carried out in a batch reactor under different conditions: pressure of 160??bar, temperatures of 80, 120, and 200????C, presence or absence of liquid water. Initial reaction rates are proposed, based on two independent techniques: measurements of the advancement of reaction by X-ray diffractometry (i.e. quantification of newly formed mineral assemblage), and monitoring of volume of CO2 injected into the batch reactor to compensate for pressure drop during the experiment (CO2 consumption, exsolution of secondary H2O). The scanning electron microscopy observations show two different behaviours: in the presence of liquid water, the reaction leads to the complete carbonation of the portlandite into calcite. On the other hand, in the absence of a liquid phase, partial carbonation leads to the passivation of the portlandite surface by precipitation of a coating of tiny calcite crystals, and an incomplete weathering reaction of the portlandite. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	According to the new integral model for bioleaching presented here,
	metal sulfides are degraded by a chemical attack of iron(III) ions
	and/or protons on the crystal lattice. The primary iron(III) ions
	are supplied by the bacterial extracellular polymeric substances,
	where they are complexed to glucuronic acid residues. The mechanism
	and chemistry of the degradation is determined by the mineral structure.
	The disulfides pyrite (FeS2), molybdenite (MoS2), and tungstenite
	(WS2) are degraded via the main intermediate thiosulfate. Exclusively
	iron(III) ions are the oxidizing agents for the dissolution. Thiosulfate
	is, consequently, degraded in a cyclic process to sulfate, with elemental
	sulfur being a side product. This explains, why only iron(II) ion-oxidizing
	bacteria are able to oxidize these metal sulfides. The metal sulfides
	galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), hauerite (MnS2),
	orpiment (As2S3), and realgar (As4S4) are degradable by iron(III)
	ion and proton attack. Consequently, the main intermediates are polysulfides
	and elemental sulfur (thiosulfate is only a by-product of further
	degradation steps). The dissolution proceeds via a H2S*+-radical
	and polysulfides to elemental sulfur. Thus, these metal sulfides
	are degradable by all bacteria able to oxidize sulfur compounds (like
	T. thiooxidans, etc.). The kinetics of these processes are dependent
	on the concentration of the iron(III) ions and, in the latter case,
	on the solubility product of the metal sulfide.},

Solid products from pyrolysis were characterized with infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Triazines and heptazines were found as solid products of pyrolysis for the tested solids. Crystallite sizes were assessed using the Scherrer equation; it was found that guanidinium acetate and guanidinium chloride had the biggest crystallites of all solids analyzed (maximums of 113 and 109 nm for guanidinium acetate and guanidinium chloride, respectively) up to 350 °C. These compounds also showed the highest decomposition temperatures, with thermal decomposition starting at 246 °C for guanidinium acetate and 300 °C for guanidinium chloride. This results show the composition of the solid and gaseous products for guanidinium acetate, carbonate and chloride, along with identification of ammonia production of guanidinium salts, which offer an important comparative with the thermal decomposition of well-known ammonia precursor compounds like urea and ammonium carbamate.},

Both evolved gases and urea residue were analyzed, and profiles of substances present versus temperature are given. Major reaction intermediates are also identified. Plausible reaction schemes based on product distribution in relation to temperature are proposed. Our data indicate that at temperatures in excess of 190°C, cyanuric acid (CYA), ammelide and ammeline are produced primarily from biuret. Biuret itself is a result of prior reaction of cyanic acid, HNCO, with intact urea. Cyanic acid is primarily a result of urea decomposition at temperatures in excess of 152°C. CYA and ammelide first appear at approximately 175°C, but the reaction rate is very slow. At temperatures in excess of 193°C, alternate reactions involving the decomposition of biuret substantially increases reaction rates. Several parallel processes compete for the production of products. Production of CYA, ammeline and ammelide appears complete at 250°C, after which sublimation and eventual decomposition of products occurs. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	microbial growth and decay, has been developed to simulate biological
	clogging in unsaturated soils, specifically biofilters. The bacterial
	growth and rate of solute reduction due to biodegradation is estimated
	using the Monod equation. The effect of microbial growth is considered

	of the model are presented in this study. Using the model, the clogging

	by the hydraulic properties of the soil. Clogging is delayed in soils
	with higher saturated hydraulic conductivities, and higher porosities.
	For the relative permeability model proposed, higher van Genuchten
	n values lead to a delay in clogging. The model was also used to
	simulate the progressive clogging of a septic bed as the biomat initially

  abstract = {A multicomponent reactive transport model with mixed equilibrium and
	kinetic reactions is used to analyze alteration front geometry in
	discrete fracture-matrix systems. An analytical solution is used
	to verify the numerical model and to obtain an expression for mineral
	reaction front geometry under quasi-stationary state conditions.
	Both the analytical solution and numerical results suggest that the
	geometry of reaction fronts in a discrete fracture system can be
	characterized by the sum of two dimensionless parameters: ??D'/??v
	(?? = porosity, D' = effective diffusion coefficient in rock matrix,
	?? = fracture aperture half-width, and v = fluid velocity in the
	fracture) and ??(m)/??(f)/0 (??(m) = equilibration length scale in
	rock matrix and ??(f)/0 = equilibration length scale in the fracture
	in the absence of matrix diffusion). In the case where the system
	is surface reaction-controlled, the first dimensionless parameter,
	which is independent of the reaction rate constants, dominates. From
	an analysis of a system described by linear reaction rates, this
	parameter can be used to predict quasi-stationary state concentration
	profiles and the distribution of minerals along the length of a fracture
	based on the one-dimensional diffusion-reaction profile in the rock
	matrix bordering the fracture. Numerical simulations of a multi-component
	problem involving dedolomitization resulting from the infiltration
	of hyperalkaline groundwater demonstrate that the dimensionless parameter
	??D'/??v applies in more complicated multicomponent systems as well.
	This result suggests that field observations of matrix alteration
	perpendicular to the fracture may be used to predict mineralization
	along the fracture itself.},

	that the width of intense rock alteration zone bordering the fractures
	changes from about 4 mm at one locality (the M1 sampling site) to
	approximately 1 mm 100 m to the north-west in the flow direction
	(the M2 site), suggesting a lessening of alteration intensity in
	that direction. Using this information, the dimensionless parameter
	??v/??D' (?? = porosity D' = effective diffusion coefficient in rock
	matrix, ?? = fracture aperture, and v = fluid velocity in the fracture)
	and measurements of the local hydraulic head gradient and effective
	diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix, a mean fracture aperture
	of 0.194 mm is calculated assuming the cubic law applies. This information,
	in combination with measured groundwater compositions at the Maqarin
	site, is used as input for numerical simulations of the hyperalkaline
	groundwater infiltration along fractures. The width of the alteration
	zones in the rock matrix bordering fractures is also used to constrain
	mineral dissolution rates in the field. The simulations predict that
	ettringite [Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12??26H2O] with lesser amounts of hillebrandite
	and tobermorite (hydrated calcium silicates or CSH phases) will be
	the dominant alteration products forming at the expense of the primary
	silicates in the rock matrix and fracture, in agreement with observations
	at the Maqarin site. The simulations also come close to matching
	the pH of water samples collected along fractures at the M1 and M2
	sites, with a fracture aperture of 0.22 mm giving the closest match
	with the pH data (within 13\% of the value indicated by the rock
	matrix alteration widths). The simulations suggest two possible scenarios
	for the time evolution of the fracture-rock matrix system. Where
	rate constants for secondary mineral precipitation reactions are
	the same in both the rock matrix and fracture, the rock matrix tends
	to become competeley cemented before the fracture. This results in
	a downstream migration of the hyperalkaline plume. In contrast, if
	rates are as little as one order of magnitude higher in the fracture
	than in the rock matrix, it is possible to seal the fracture first,
	thus causing the mineral zons to collapse upstream as a result of
	the reduction in fracture permeability. Sealing of fractures is observed
	at Maqarin and the simulations predict a mineral paragenesis in the
	fracture resulting from this scenario which is broadly compatible
	with field observations.},

	given to changes in the porosity, permeability, and dispersivity
	resulting from the biofilm altering the microscopic geometry of the

  abstract = {From laboratory experiments it is known that bacterial biomass is
	able to influence the hydraulic properties of saturated porous media,
	an effect called bioclogging. To interpret the observations of these
	experiments and to predict possible bioclogging effects on the field
	scale it is necessary to use transport models, which are able to
	include bioclogging. For these models it is necessary to know the
	relation between the amount of biomass and the hydraulic conductivity
	of the porous medium. Usually these relations were determined using
	bundles of parallel pore channels and do not account for interconnections
	between the pores in more than one dimension. The present study uses
	two-dimensional pore network models to study the effects of bioclogging
	on the pore scale. Numerical simulations were done for two different
	scenarios of the growth of biomass in the pores. Scenario 1 assumes
	microbial growth in discrete colonies clogging particular pores completely.
	Scenario 2 assumes microbial growth as a biofilm growing on the wall
	of each pore. In both scenarios the hydraulic conductivity was reduced
	by at least two orders of magnitude, but for the colony scenario
	much less biomass was needed to get a maximal clogging effect and
	a better agreement with previously published experimental data could
	be found. For both scenarios it was shown that heterogeneous pore
	networks could be clogged with less biomass than more homogeneous
	ones.},

  abstract = {For many years, controversy has surrounded the use of biofilm models
	to describe the distribution of microbial biomass in natural or artificial
	porous media. This use is often advocated on the basis of the relative
	mathematical simplicity of the biofilm concept, and of the widespread
	availability of analytical solutions or numerical implementations.
	However, microscopic observations consistently point to a patchy,
	rather than homogeneous, distribution of microorganisms at the pore
	scale in many porous media of interest, even under conditions of
	severe bioclogging. Also, bioclogging models involving biofilms tend
	to underpredict the extent of permeability reductions in all be the
	coarse-textured materials. In this context, computer simulations
	described in the present article show that some of the limitations
	of biofilm models to describe the bioclogging of porous media are
	linked to the common constitutive assumption that biofilms are impermeable,
	that is, that nutrient transport occurs through the biofilms only
	by molecular diffusion. When this restriction is alleviated and liquid
	flow is allowed in the biofilms, the level of bioclogging achievable
	by a given biomass is very significantly increased and is comparable
	to that observed in experiments. In addition, the distribution of
	microorganisms becomes patchy and exhibits a self-organized periodic
	pattern with pores either entirely filled with biomass or without
	any biomass at all, again similar to published microscopic observations.
	These results suggest that biofilm models should not be ruled out
	a priori for the quantitative description of bioclogging in porous
	media, as long as biofilms are allowed to be permeable.},

  abstract = {{We examine the motion of a high-pressure aqueous solution, through
	a low-permeability fracture, towards a low-pressure well. As the
	liquid decompresses in the fractures it expands, and for sufficiently
	high initial temperature the liquid reaches the boiling point. A
	vaporization front then develops, so that vapour issues from the
	well. As the fluid evaporates near the well, the salt concentration
	of the residual fluid increases. If the salt concentration increases
	beyond the saturation limit, then the evaporation leads to precipitation
	of salt in the fracture. We find a new family of self-similar solutions
	to describe the boiling and precipitation in a single idealized fracture,
	which at long times remains approximately isothermal owing to the
	cross-fracture heat transfer. The solutions describe the mass of
	salt that precipitates as a function of the initial salt concentration,
	the reservoir temperature and pressure, and the well pressure. In
	fact, this family of self-similar solutions is multi-valued: we identify
	a liquid-advection-dominated regime, in which the boiling front advances
	slowly and the fracture porosity decreases significantly, and a boiling-dominated
	regime, in which the boiling front advances more rapidly, and less
	precipitate forms at each point in the fracture. As the pressure
	difference between the well and the far field reservoir increases,
	these solutions converge, and eventually coincide. Beyond this critical
	point, there is no similarity solution, since the advective flux
	of salt from the far-field would produce more precipitate than can
	be taken up in the fracture adjacent to the boiling front. Instead,
	the rock will become fully scaled through precipitation, thereby
	suppressing flow into the well. We extend the model to show that
	an analogous result also occurs within an extensive porous layer.
	However in that case, the system is not isothermal; instead, the
	heat flux is supplied in the direction of flow, while the cross-flow
	heat flux is small. We discuss the relevance of the work to the natural
	venting of steam in high-temperature geothermal systems.}},

	to be the fact that microbial communities intercept and consume methane
	from anoxic environments, methane that would otherwise enter the
	atmosphere. Anaerobic methane oxidation is biogeochemically important
	because methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and
	is abundant in anoxic environments. Geochemical evidence for this
	process has been observed in numerous marine sediments along the
	continental margins, in methane seeps and vents, around methane hydrate
	deposits, and in anoxic waters. The anaerobic oxidation of methane
	is performed by at least two phylogenetically distinct groups of
	archaea, the ANME-1 and ANME-2. These archaea are frequently observed
	as consortia with sulfate-reducing bacteria, and the metabolism of
	these consortia presumably involves a syntrophic association based
	on interspecies electron transfer. The archaeal member of a consortium
	apparently oxidizes methane and shuttles reduced compounds to the
	sulfate-reducing bacteria. Despite recent advances in understanding
	anaerobic methane oxidation, uncertainties still remain regarding
	the nature and necessity of the syntrophic association, the biochemical
	pathway of methane oxidation, and the interaction of the process
	with the local chemical and physical environment. This review will
	consider the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of anaerobic methane
	oxidation with a special emphasis on the interactions between the

  abstract =  {The potential impact to the integrity of wellbore cements as a result of exposure to supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) has been raised as an area of some concern with respect to long-term effectiveness of CO2 storage in geological formations. In flow-through experiments we simulated diffusion of brine and SCCO2 from the interface between wellbore cement and caprock into a fracture-bearing Portland cement. The experiments were performed at in-situ reservoir pressure (pore pressure: 19.9??MPa) and temperature (54????C) conditions for 113??days. For this purpose we saturated illite-rich shale and the Portland cement core (2.02??cm ?? 5.35??cm) with 1.65??M brine for 14??days. After this period of time we injected SCCO2 into the system for 99??days and simulated a diffusion process by using a pressure gradient of 0.7??MPa. Calcite precipitation occurred within the fracture and the induced pressure of crystal growth may explain an increase in the relative permeability along the fracture with time. SCCO2-induced reactions extended {\~{}} 5??mm into the Portland cement core from the fracture and formed an orange-colored zone. The orange-colored zone is nearly completely carbonated with crystalline phases consisting mainly of calcite, aragonite, and vaterite. The only crystalline cement component that persisted in the orange-colored zone was brownmillerite. Interior portions of the hydrated cement were partially carbonated, modified in texture and contained newly formed calcite, hydrogarnet and hydrocalumite (Friedel's salt). Cement porosity decreased from 37.8{\%} to 23.8{\%} during carbonation and was associated with a 19.6{\%} increase in mass. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Many important applications in porous media require the large-scale
	simulation of complex physical processes. Due to the limitations
	of computational resources, huge model domains often have to be simulated
	on relatively coarse grids. However, depending on the application,
	a high spatial resolution may be necessary to capture important effects,
	for example due to small-scale heterogeneities. One solution strategy
	is multiscale modeling. The idea is to decrease the number of global
	degrees of freedom while preserving important fine-scale features.
	In this work, we present a multiscale approach for modeling two-phase
	flow in porous media, which is applicable in a wide range of flow
	regimes, but especially if the influence of capillary pressure is
	significant. In this case, many existing upscaling or multiscale
	techniques, originally developed and successfully used for advection-dominated
	systems, fail or are not able to yield sufficiently accurate results.
	We combine an adaptive grid method based on multipoint flux approximation
	with various local upscaling techniques. In particular, the numerical
	method has to be able to treat complex effective parameters like
	anisotropic phase permeabilities. A crucial point is the development
	of suitable grid-adaptation strategies to account correctly for important
	effects. The method is tested and proven to work for various examples
	including varying heterogeneous parameter fields and different flow
	regimes.},

  abstract =  {In the present study, the inactivation effect of scutellarin (SL) on jack bean urease was investigated to elucidate the inhibitory potency, kinetics and mechanism of inhibition. It was revealed that SL acted as a concentration- and time-dependent inactivator of urease characteristic of slow-binding inhibition with an IC50 of 1.35 ± 0.15 mM. The rapid formation of the initial SL-urease complex with an inhibition constant of Ki = 5.37 × 10- 2 mM was followed by a slow isomerization into the final complex with the overall inhibition constant of Ki* = 3.49 × 10- 3 mM. High effectiveness of thiol protectors, such as L-cysteine (L-cys), 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and dithiothreitol (DTT) significantly slowed down the rate of inactivation, indicating the strategic role of the active site sulfhydryl group in the blocking process. While the insignificant protection by boric acid and fluoride from the inactivation further confirmed that the active site cysteine should be obligatory for urease inhibition, which was also rationalized by the molecular docking study. The inhibition of SL on urease proved to be reversible since SL-blocked urease could be reactivated by DTT application and multidilution. The results obtained indicated that urease inactivation resulted from the reaction between SL and the sulfhydryl group. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A general 2-D finite element multi-component reactive transport code,
	TRANQUI, was developed, using a sequential iteration approach (SIA).
	It is well suited to deal with complex real-world thermo-hydro-geochemical
	problems for single-phase variably water saturated porous media flow
	systems. The model considers a wide range of hydrological and thermodynamic
	as well as chemical processes such as aqueous complexation, acid-base,
	redox, mineral dissolution/precipitation, gas dissolution/ex-solution,
	ion exchange and adsorption via surface complexation. Under unsaturated
	conditions only water flow is considered, although gas pressures
	are allowed to vary in space in a depth-dependent manner specified
	by the user. In addition to the fully iterative sequential approach
	(SIA), a sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA), in which transport
	and chemistry are de-coupled, was implemented and tested. The accuracy
	and numerical performance of SIA and SNIA have been compared using
	several test cases. The accuracy of SNIA depends on space and time
	discretization as well as on the nature of the chemical reactions.
	The capability of the code to model a real case study in the field
	is illustrated by its application to the modeling of the hydrochemical
	evolution of the Llobregat Delta aquitard in northeastern Spain over
	the last 3500 years during when fresh-water flow from a lower aquifer
	displaced the native saline aquitard waters. Manzano and Custodio
	carried out a reactive transport model of this case study by using
	the PHREEQM code and considering water flow, aqueous complexation,
	cation exchange and calcite dissolution. Their results compare favorably
	well with measured porewater chemical data, except for some of the
	cations. Our code is not only able to reproduce the results of previous
	numerical models, but leads to computed concentrations which are
	closer to measured data mainly because our model takes into consideration
	redox processes in addition to the processes mentioned above. A number
	of sensitivity runs were performed with TRANQUI in order to analyze
	the effect of errors and uncertainties on cation selectivities.},

  abstract = {The percolation flux in the unsaturated zone (UZ) is an important
	parameter addressed in site characterization and flow and transport
	modeling of the potential nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain,
	NV, USA. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has documented hydrogenic
	calcite abundances in fractures and lithophysal cavities at Yucca
	Mountain to provide constraints on percolation fluxes in the UZ.
	The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
	percolation flux and measured calcite abundances using reactive transport
	modeling. Our model considers the following essential factors affecting
	calcite precipitation: (1) infiltration, (2) the ambient geothermal
	gradient, (3) gaseous CO(2) diffusive transport and partitioning
	in liquid and gas phases, (4) fracture-matrix interaction for water
	flow and chemical constituents, and (5) water-rock interaction. Over
	a bounding range of 2-20 mm/year infiltration rate, the simulated
	calcite distributions capture the trend in calcite abundances measured
	in a deep borehole (WT-24) by the USGS. The calcite is found predominantly
	in fractures in the welded tuffs, which is also captured by the model
	simulations. Simulations showed that from about 2 to 6 mm/year, the
	amount of calcite precipitated in the welded Topopah Spring tuff
	is sensitive to the infiltration rate. This dependence decreases
	at higher infiltration rates owing to a modification of the geothermal
	gradient from the increased percolation flux. The model also confirms
	the conceptual model for higher percolation fluxes in the fractures
	compared to the matrix in the welded units, and the significant contribution
	of Ca from water-rock interaction. This study indicates that reactive
	transport modeling of calcite deposition can yield important constraints
	on the unsaturated zone infiltration-percolation flux and provide
	useful insight into processes such as fracture-matrix interaction
	as well as conditions and parameters controlling calcite deposition.},

  abstract = {TOUGHREACT is a numerical simulation program for chemically reactive
	non-isothermal flows of multiphase fluids in porous and fractured
	media. The program was written in Fortran 77 and developed by introducing
	reactive geochemistry into the multiphase fluid and heat flow simulator
	TOUGH2. A variety of subsurface thermo-physical-chemical processes
	are considered under a wide range of conditions of pressure, temperature,
	water saturation, ionic strength, and pH and Eh. Interactions between
	mineral assemblages and fluids can occur under local equilibrium
	or kinetic rates. The gas phase can be chemically active. Precipitation
	and dissolution reactions can change formation porosity and permeability.
	The program can be applied to many geologic systems and environmental
	problems, including geothermal systems, diagenetic, and weathering
	processes, subsurface waste disposal, acid mine drainage remediation,
	contaminant transport, and groundwater quality. Here we present two
	examples to illustrate applicability of the program. The first example
	deals with injectivity effects of mineral scaling in a fractured
	geothermal reservoir. A major concern in the development of hot dry
	rock and hot fractured rock reservoirs is achieving and maintaining
	adequate injectivity, while avoiding the development of preferential
	short-circuiting flow paths. Rock-fluid interactions and associated
	mineral dissolution and precipitation effects could have a major
	impact on the long-term performance of these reservoirs. We used
	recent European studies as a starting point to explore chemically
	induced effects of fluid circulation in the geothermal systems. We
	examine ways in which the chemical composition of reinjected waters
	can be modified to improve reservoir performance by maintaining or
	even enhancing injectivity. The second TOUGHREACT application example
	is related to CO2 geologic sequestration in a saline aquifer. We
	performed numerical simulations for a commonly encountered Gulf Coast
	sediment under CO2 injection conditions in order to analyze the impact
	of CO2 immobilization through carbonate precipitation. Using the
	data presented in this paper, the CO2 mineral-trapping capability
	after 10,000 years can reach 60 kg/m3 of sandstone by secondary carbonate
	mineral precipitation such as siderite, ankerite, and dawsonite.
	Most of the simulated mineral alteration pattern is consistent with
	the field observations of natural CO2 reservoirs. ?? 2005 Elsevier

	strength of the samples treated with <10vol\% calcium carbonate precipitation
	against the initial pore volume ranges from ∼400kPa to 1.6MPa. Likewise,
	the hydraulic test results indicate the significant impervious effects

	shows more than one order of magnitude smaller than that of the untreated
	soils. Evolutions in the measured hydraulic conductivity and porosity

  abstract = {A step-wise numerical calculation method was developed to provide predictions of when and where carbonate deposits might be found through reservoirs during CO2 sequestration. Flow experiments through porous media using a supersaturated carbonate fluid were also performed in order to observe flow rates. In order to evaluate precipitation rates and permeability change in the formation, calculated flow rates based on the proposed geochemical clogging model were compared with the experimentally observed data. Both high and low temperature cases were studied to understand how hydrothermal conditions can affect precipitation rates of carbonate. According to chemical kinetics, growth rates of minerals are generally proportional to the saturation index (S.I.) that depends on temperature. Thus, a supersaturated fluid has the advantage of improving the filtration and the amount of C fixation (??). However, when the ratio of filtration coefficient (??) to pore fluid velocity (u) increases, the permeability around the injection point tends to be significantly reduced by carbonate accumulation, and thus, this might result in insufficient injection of CO2. Therefore, it is essential to understand how to control both ?? and u so that the precipitation of carbonate can be located as far away from the inlet as possible. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {A two-step mechanism for non-catalytic thermal decomposition of urea was investigated. It involves a first order reaction for the thermolysis of urea and a pseudo-first order reaction for hydrolysis of isocyanic acid. Rate constants of these reactions were tuned on experimental measurements of NH3 and HNCO concentrations at 423-723 K and 1083-1383 K in isothermal flow reactors made of aluminum and ceramic, respectively. A regression analysis by taking the uncertainties in the kinetic parameters into account shown that the resultant pairs of Arrhenius expressions for thermo-hydrolyzing urea were different with a 90{\%} confidence when obtained from the different sets of experimental data. Additional results of ammonia concentration from experiments of urea solution decomposition reported in the literature revealed the reliability of the Arrhenius expressions tuned on the reaction rates obtained in the highest range of temperature in the ceramic reactor. The consistency of these equations was also verified by a comparison between calculated and experimental rates of selective non-catalytic reduction of nitric oxide with urea as reducing agent. A statistical analysis based on the identification of possible tendencies in these residuals again evidences the weakness of the Arrhenius expressions based on the experiments performed at lower temperatures, which was attributed to a non-expected catalytic effect of aluminum reactor walls on reactions rates of urea thermal decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

There are none in the open literature for oilfield conditions (temperature {\textgreater} 100??C, pressure {\textgreater}200 bar and salinity {\textgreater}0.5 mol kg-1). In this work the kinetics of calcite (CaCO3) precipitation from high salinity waters (up to 2 mol kg-1) have been studied by a pH-free-drift method in a closed water system. This method is much easier to operate than the often used steady-state method. The experimental results indicate that the calcite precipitation rate is not only affected by the solution CaCO3 saturation level, but also by the solution pH, ionic strength and the concentration ratios of Ca to HCO3- ions (C(Ca2+)/C(HCO3/-)). When the concentration ratios of Ca to HCO3 - ions are close to their chemical stoichiometric ratio of 0.5, the calcite growth from a supersaturated solution is believed to be surface reaction controlled. However, at higher C(Ca2+)/C(HCO3/-) ratios, the transportation of the lattice ions to calcite crystal surface has to be considered.},

An exponential equation is presented to predict the initial rate of reaction as a function of temperature. The microstructure shows that large equant calcite crystals, up to 30 $\mu$m, develop on the rhomboid cleavage surfaces of dolomite. Pressed pellets of dolomite develop calcite at both exterior surfaces and in the interior, where calcite develops as a secondary phase but is not morphologically well-formed crystals. Pellets remain coherent in the course of reaction. The porous pellets have much unfilled space inside and often exhibit portlandite agglomerates with development of Hadley grain structures at the sites of former dolomite crystals, especially when reacted at lower temperatures. The reaction is not topotactic but requires dissolution, transport, nucleation and growth. Transport occurs often over considerable distance relative to the sizes of crystals. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Reactive transport is simulated for a 5-year period of infiltration

Experiments were conducted at 298.15 K and at four different CO2 partial pressures. A constant addition technique was used to maintain [Ca2+] at 10.5 mmol/kg, while [CO3(2-)] was varied to isolate the role of this variable on the precipitation rate of calcite. Like in seawater solutions, calcite precipitation in the NaCl-CaCl2 solution is dominated by the following reaction: [GRAPHICS] where k(f1) and k(b1) are, respectively, the forward and backward reaction rate constants. The net precipitation rate, R, can be described at any given P(CO2) by R = k(f1)(a(Ca))na(a(CO3))nb - k(b1) or log (R + k(b1)) = log K(f1) + 3 log [CO3(2-)], where a(i) are n(i) are, respectively, the activity and partial reaction order of the species involved in the reaction, K(f1) = k1(a(Ca)2+)na(gammaCo3(2-)3 and gamma is the activity coefficient. The partial reaction order with respect to the CO3(2-) ion concentration is, as in seawater solutions, equal to 3. Unlike seawater, however, the intercept, log K(f1), increases with increasing P(CO2). This is interpreted as a contribution of the HCO3- ion to the precipitation reaction. Its role was evaluated from the difference in the net rate R at every P(CO2) and a fixed [CO3(2-)]. Solution of a system of nonlinear equations allowed us to determine that the partial reaction order with respect to the HCO3- ion concentration is nearly equal to 2 and represented by the following reaction: [GRAPHICS] Under our experimental conditions (1.1 {\textless} OMEGA(c) {\textless} 8.3, where OMEGA(c) is the saturation state of the solution with respect to calcite), the calcite precipitation rate can be described by the following expression: R = K(f1)[CO3(2-)]3 - k(b1) + K(f2)[HCO3-]2 - k(b2) (gammaH2CO3.)alphaP(CO2), where K(f2) = k2(a(Ca)2+)nd(gammaHCO3-)2 and alpha is the solubility of CO2 in the experimental solution. We propose that, since the partial reaction order with respect to [CO3(2-)] is the same in both seawater and our experimental NaCl-CaCl2 solutions, the precipitation mechanism of pure calcite in the latter solution may be similar to that of a 8 mol{\%} magnesian calcite from seawater. We suggest that Mg2+ and SO4(2-) ions, which are both major seawater constituents and calcite growth inhibitors, may not modify the precipitation mechanism, but decrease the rate constants of individual reactions. Finally, as opposed to our observations in the NaCl-CaCl2 solution, the lack of P(CO2) dependence reported for calcite precipitation rates measured in seawater may be explained by a differential inhibition of the reactions participating in the overall growth process.},

  abstract = {To characterize the influence of ionic strength on the kinetics of calcite precipiation from seawater solutions we carried out a set of experiments at four different ionic strengths (I = 0.10; 0.34; 0.55; 0.93 m) in NaCl-CaCl2 solutions, at the temperature of 298.15K and a CO2 partial pressure of 100 Pa. The constant addition technique was used in order to maintain [Ca2+] at ???10.5 mmol/kg, while the [CO3
2-] was varied to isolate its role on the precipitation rate of calcite. Results of this study indicate that, when the ionic strength is increased from 0.10 to 0.93 m, the partial reaction order with respect to the CO3
2- concentration increases from 1 to 3 and the forward reaction rate constant, kf, increases by several orders of magnitude. This is interpreted as both a change in the calcite precipitation mechanism and a catalysis generated by the presence of inert electrolytes. Applying our model to the rate measurements carried out by Zhong and Mucci (1989) in seawater solutions at various salinities, under the compositional condition [Ca2+] ??? [CO3
2-], we find that partial reaction order with respect to the carbonate ion and the forward reaction rate constant increase as a function of the total ionic strength of the seawater solutions. A 50{\%} increase of the total ionic strength of the parent solution results in an increase of the precipitation rate by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we propose that ion interactions in solution and a concomitant change of the precipitation mechanism may contribute to the development of nonequivalent kink sites of different sizes on the surface of the growing crystal but which still satisfy the symmetry. Variations in the amount of foreign ions adsorbed and incorporated into marine calcites could, therefore, be determined by the density of these less constrained sites, which, in turn, would be dependent on the total ionic strength of the solution.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of urea nitrogen onto chitosan coated dialdehyde cellulose (CDAC) under urease catalysis was studied in a batch system. The equilibrium isotherm of urea nitrogen adsorption onto CDACs with different degree of oxidation (DO) and the kinetics of adsorption with respect to the DO of CDAC (41, 60 and 74{\%}), the initial urea nitrogen concentration (544, 635 and 785 mg L-1), temperature (37, 42 and 47??C) and CDAC/urease weight ratio (100:3, 100:2 and 100:1) were investigated. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were applied to describe the experimental isotherm and isotherm constants. Equilibrium data fitted very well to the Langmuir model in the entire saturation concentration range (152-756 mg L-1). The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities obtained from the Langmuir model are 50.0, 60.6 and 69.2 mg g-1 for the CDACs with DO 41, 60 and 74{\%}, respectively, at 37??C and CDAC/urease weight ratio 50:1. Pseudo first-order and second-order kinetic models were used to describe the kinetic data and the rate constants were evaluated. The experimental data fitted well to the second-order kinetic model, which indicates that chemical adsorption is the rate-limiting step, instead of mass transfer. The DO of CDAC, initial urea nitrogen concentration, temperature and CDAC/urease weight ratio affected the adsorption capacity significantly. The activation energy is 11.64 kJ mol-1 for the adsorption of the urea nitrogen onto the CDAC under urease catalysation at DO 74{\%} of CDAC, initial urea nitrogen concentration 635 mg L-1 and CDAC/urease weight ratio 50:1. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
